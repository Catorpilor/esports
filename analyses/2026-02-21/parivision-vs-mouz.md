## 2. Team Overview

| Metric | PARIVISION | MOUZ | Edge |
|--------|-----------|------|------|
| HLTV Ranking | #6 | #3 | MOUZ |
| Roster | BELCHONOKK, Jame, nota, xiELO, zweih | Brollan, Spinx, xertioN, Jimpphat, torzsi | MOUZ |
| Coach | dastan | sycrone | — |
| PGL Swiss Record | 3-2 (advanced) | 3-0 (advanced) | MOUZ |

| Star player | Jame (AWP) | Jimpphat / Brollan | MOUZ |

## 4. Actual Veto

| Step | Action | Map | Notes |
|------|--------|-----|-------|
| 1 | PRV ban | Nuke | Standard PRV permaban |
| 2 | MOUZ ban | Anubis | MOUZ permaban |
| 3 | PRV pick | **Dust2** | PRV's signature — won 13-7 vs MOUZ 6 days ago |
| 4 | MOUZ pick | **Inferno** | MOUZ won 13-7 vs PRV 6 days ago |
| 5 | MOUZ ban | Ancient | Remove PRV option |
| 6 | PRV ban | Overpass | Smart — MOUZ destroyed them 13-3 on it |
| 7 | Decider | **Mirage** | Leftover |

### Veto Comparison vs Swiss R1 (Feb 14)

| Step | Swiss R1 | Semifinal (Today) | Changed? |
|------|----------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | PRV ban Nuke | PRV ban Nuke | Same |
| 2 | MOUZ ban Anubis | MOUZ ban Anubis | Same |
| 3 | PRV pick Dust2 | PRV pick Dust2 | Same |
| 4 | MOUZ pick Inferno | MOUZ pick Inferno | Same |
| 5 | MOUZ ban Mirage | MOUZ ban **Ancient** | **Changed** |
| 6 | PRV ban Ancient | PRV ban **Overpass** | **Changed** |
| 7 | Overpass (decider) | **Mirage** (decider) | **Changed** |

The first 4 steps are identical. The adjustment: MOUZ now leaves Mirage as decider instead of Overpass — and PRV bans Overpass (where they got destroyed 13-3) instead of Ancient. Both teams adapted from the Swiss match.

## 5. Map-by-Map Predictions

### Map 1: Dust2 (PRV Pick)

- PRV won this exact matchup 13-7 six days ago
- PRV's signature map (~83% WR from tournament data)
- Per Principle #30 (Anti-Strat Tax), MOUZ has now seen PRV's Dust2 and can prepare specifically
- Per Principle #36, pick maps get stolen ~40-45% of the time at top level
- **Prediction: PRV wins 13-9**
- **Confidence: Medium** (PRV's Dust2 is strong but MOUZ will be better prepared this time)

### Map 2: Inferno (MOUZ Pick)

- MOUZ won 13-7 vs PRV on Inferno 6 days ago
- MOUZ dominated NAVI 13-4 on Inferno yesterday — peak form on this map
- Jimpphat is a monster on Inferno
- **Prediction: MOUZ wins 13-8**
- **Confidence: Medium** (MOUZ's Inferno form is excellent but PRV will have studied the Swiss tape)

### Map 3: Mirage (Decider)

- No direct H2H data on Mirage between these teams
- MOUZ has been dominant on Mirage all tournament (13-7 vs NAVI, 13-8 vs FUT)
- PRV lost 13-8 on Mirage to FURIA (Feb 17) as a decider
- MOUZ's Mirage experience is deeper and more recent
- **Prediction: MOUZ wins 13-10**
- **Confidence: Medium**

## 6. Player Matchups

| Player | Team | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|------|-------|
| Jimpphat | MOUZ | Star rifler | 1.54 rating on Overpass vs PRV; monster form all tournament |
| Brollan | MOUZ | Rifler | Consistent high-impact player |
| torzsi | MOUZ | AWP | Experienced AWPer, 670 maps on this roster |
| Jame | PRV | AWP/IGL | Legendary AWPer, save-heavy style, 381 maps on PRV |
| BELCHONOKK | PRV | Star rifler | 532 maps — PRV's backbone |
| zweih | PRV | Rifler | New (1 month, 42 maps) — unknown factor |

**AWP Matchup:** torzsi vs Jame. Both are elite AWPers. Jame's save-heavy style can be exploited on T sides. torzsi is more aggressive. Edge: roughly even, slight MOUZ for aggression.

## 7. Tournament Context

- **Stage:** Legends Stage Semifinal — winner advances to the **Grand Final**
- **Stakes:** Massive — this is for a spot in the PGL Cluj-Napoca 2026 Grand Final
- **MOUZ path:** 3-0 Swiss → beat NAVI 2-1 QF → here
- **PRV path:** 3-2 Swiss → presumably won QF → here
- **Crowd:** LAN in Cluj-Napoca. MOUZ likely has more international fan support.
- **Momentum:** MOUZ is on a tear — undefeated at this event (3-0 Swiss + NAVI QF)

## 8. Series Prediction

**MOUZ wins 2-1** (lose Dust2, win Inferno + Mirage)

**Confidence: Medium**

**Most Likely Scenarios:**
1. **35%** — MOUZ 2-0 (steal Dust2, win Inferno)
2. **28%** — MOUZ 2-1 (lose Dust2, win Inferno + Mirage)
3. **22%** — PRV 2-1 (win Dust2, steal one of Inferno/Mirage)
4. **15%** — PRV 2-0 (unlikely — would need to steal Inferno)

**MOUZ ML: ~63%** | Polymarket: 59.5%

## 9. Prediction vs Market

| Outcome | My Probability | Polymarket | Edge | Signal |
|---------|---------------|------------|------|--------|
| MOUZ ML | 63% | 59.5% | +3.5% | Slight value, within noise |
| PRV ML | 37% | 40.5% | -3.5% | No value |
| Map 1 PRV | 58-60% | 54.5% | +4-5% | Slight value |
| Map 2 MOUZ | 65-68% | 63% | +2-5% | No value |
| Over 2.5 | 50-52% | 46.5% | +4-5% | Marginal |
| Under 2.5 | 48-50% | 53.5% | — | No value |
| PRV +1.5 | 78% | 65.5% | +12.5% | **VALUE** |

**Value Plays:**

- **PRV +1.5 at 65.5% — BEST BET** (model: ~78%, edge: +12.5%). PRV won Dust2 13-7 against MOUZ 6 days ago. Even if MOUZ takes the series, PRV almost certainly takes at least Dust2. A team with an elite signature map and a 13-7 H2H win on it should win at least 1 map ~78% of the time.
