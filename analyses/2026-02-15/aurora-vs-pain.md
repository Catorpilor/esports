## 2. Map Pool Analysis

### Current Active Duty Pool (Jan 2026)
Mirage, Inferno, Nuke, Dust2, Ancient, Overpass, Anubis

### Map Pool Matrix (Last 3 months)

| Map | Aurora Win% | Aurora Played | paiN Win% | paiN Played | Advantage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Anubis | HIGH (best map) | Frequent | LOW (permaban) | Rare | **Aurora** |
| Overpass | HIGH (~70%+) | Frequent | LOW | Moderate | **Aurora** |
| Mirage | MODERATE | Moderate | HIGH | Frequent (pick) | **paiN** |
| Inferno | MODERATE | Moderate | MODERATE | Moderate | Even |
| Nuke | LOW-MOD | Avoided | MODERATE | Moderate | Slight paiN |
| Ancient | LOW (banned) | Rare | MODERATE | Moderate | Slight paiN |
| Dust2 | MODERATE | Moderate | MODERATE | Moderate | Even (volatile) |

### Map Classification

```
AURORA MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Ancient (banned in IEM Kraków veto vs paiN)
├── BEST MAPS: Anubis (returned to pool Jan 2026, huge buff), Overpass
├── COMFORTABLE: Mirage (won 13-7 vs paiN on their pick), Inferno
├── AVERAGE: Dust2
└── WEAK: Nuke (banned in IEM Kraków veto vs paiN)

paiN MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Anubis (banned in IEM Kraków veto vs Aurora)
├── BEST MAPS: Mirage (frequent pick), Inferno
├── COMFORTABLE: Nuke, Ancient
├── AVERAGE: Dust2
└── WEAK: Overpass (lost 6-13 to Aurora)
```

**Key Insight:** Anubis returning to the map pool in January 2026 was a MASSIVE buff for Aurora. It was their dominant map before its mid-2025 removal, and its absence contributed to their second-half slump. paiN consistently bans it.

---

## 3. Predicted Map Veto

Based on the IEM Kraków 2026 veto (Jan 30) and team tendencies:

```
PREDICTED VETO (BO3):
1. BAN: paiN bans Anubis     — Aurora's best map, paiN's permaban
2. BAN: Aurora bans Ancient   — Aurora's weakest map, consistent ban pattern
3. PICK: Aurora picks Overpass — Aurora dominant (13-6 win vs paiN at IEM Kraków)
4. PICK: paiN picks Mirage    — paiN's best map, though lost 7-13 to Aurora last time
5. BAN: Aurora bans Nuke      — Aurora avoids this consistently
6. BAN: paiN bans Inferno     — paiN wants to avoid Aurora's utility game
7. DECIDER: Dust2             — Same decider as IEM Kraków (wasn't played in 2-0)
```

**Veto Analysis:**
- This is almost certainly an identical veto to IEM Kraków. Both teams have clear permabans (Anubis for paiN, Ancient for Aurora).
- The interesting wrinkle: paiN might consider changing their pick from Mirage after getting destroyed 7-13. But Mirage is still statistically their best map — they'll likely stick with it and adjust tactically.
- Dust2 as decider is volatile and aim-dependent, which could favor Aurora's firepower (XANTARES, woxic) but is also upset-friendly.

---

## 4. Map-by-Map Breakdown

### Map 1: Overpass (Aurora Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- Aurora: HIGH win rate, strong pick — won 13-6 vs paiN at IEM Kraków
- paiN: WEAK map — H2H record 0-2 vs Aurora on Overpass

**Key Players on This Map:**
- Aurora: XANTARES (dominant monster/connector control), woxic (aggressive AWP peeks)
- paiN: nqz (CT-side AWP setups)

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Overpass is CT-sided (~54-46%)
- Aurora excels at creative utility usage and monster control
- paiN struggled to find solutions on both sides vs Aurora (6 total rounds)

**H2H on This Map:** Aurora 2-0 in H2H on Overpass

**Predicted Score:** Aurora wins 13-7
**Confidence:** HIGH
**Key Factor:** Aurora's Overpass is elite-tier. paiN have never beaten them here. Unless paiN have developed entirely new strats in 2 weeks, Aurora should control this comfortably. The question is whether it's 13-5 or 13-9.

---

### Map 2: Mirage (paiN Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- Aurora: MODERATE — but beat paiN 13-7 ON paiN's pick at IEM Kraków
- paiN: HIGH win rate overall, but H2H 2-0 historically (older matches). Lost badly last meeting.

**Key Players on This Map:**
- Aurora: XANTARES (aim-heavy map suits him perfectly, mid-window dominance)
- paiN: biguzera (experienced on Mirage), vsm (new addition, needs to prove himself)

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Mirage is slightly CT-sided (~54% CT)
- Mid control (window/connector) is decisive — XANTARES excels here
- Aurora proved they can beat paiN on Mirage even as the non-picking team

**H2H on This Map:** paiN 2-0 historically, but Aurora won 13-7 at IEM Kraków (most recent)

**Predicted Score:** Aurora wins 13-9
**Confidence:** MEDIUM
**Key Factor:** This is the swing map. paiN MUST win their own pick to have a chance. The 13-7 IEM Kraków loss is in paiN's heads. However, paiN may have prepared specific anti-strats for Mirage knowing it's their best chance. If biguzera and nqz step up, this could be competitive. The 2-week gap gives paiN time to review demos.

---

### Map 3: Dust2 (Decider — if needed)

**Historical Performance:**
- Aurora: MODERATE — volatile, aim-dependent map
- paiN: MODERATE — got destroyed by The MongolZ here (lost 13-1 on Dust2 decider in Round 1)

**Key Players on This Map:**
- Aurora: woxic (AWP mid doors is god-tier on Dust2), XANTARES
- paiN: nqz (AWP player, but woxic has the edge on this map)

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Dust2 is T-sided (~52% T)
- AWP matchup at mid doors is THE decisive factor
- Fastest rotations = individual skill matters most

**H2H on This Map:** No recent H2H data (Dust2 was the decider at IEM Kraków but wasn't played due to 2-0)

**Predicted Score:** Aurora wins 13-10
**Confidence:** LOW (Dust2 is inherently volatile)
**Key Factor:** woxic vs nqz AWP duel at mid doors. Dust2 is the ultimate aim map — whoever has the hotter hand wins. Aurora's overall firepower (XANTARES + woxic) should edge it, but paiN's confidence from any momentum would be dangerous. paiN also has PTSD from their 13-1 Dust2 loss to MongolZ, which could either motivate or haunt them.

## 5. Player Matchups

### Star Player Comparison

| Player | Team | Rating (recent) | Role | Impact |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| XANTARES | Aurora | ~1.27 (Bucharest) | Star Rifler | Entry fragger, space creator, "wallhack" reads |
| Wicadia | Aurora | ~1.40+ (peak maps) | Rifler | Young talent, explosive ceiling, 1.77-1.79 at Bucharest |
| woxic | Aurora | ~1.57 (IEM Kraków opener) | AWPer | Aggressive style, high-risk/high-reward flicks |
| nqz | paiN | ~1.19 (PGL Cluj) | AWPer | CT-side anchor, consistent, 6 maps above 1.26 |
| vsm | paiN | ~1.29 (at Keyd Stars) | Rifler | New to paiN, unproven in this lineup at top tier |

### AWP Matchup
- **Aurora — woxic:** Aggressive, flashy AWPer. Known for insane flicks and aggressive peeks. Can solo-carry maps but also has off days. His 4-AWP-kill highlight on A-site at PGL Cluj shows his ceiling.
- **paiN — nqz:** More passive, positional AWPer. Strong CT-side anchor. Less flashy but more consistent. Stepped up at PGL Cluj with 1.19 rating.
- **Edge: Aurora (woxic)** — On LAN, woxic's ceiling is higher. His aggressive style on Overpass and Dust2 is particularly effective. nqz is solid but less impactful.

### IGL Comparison
- **Aurora — MAJ3R:** Veteran IGL. Methodical, strong utility timing, excellent mid-round caller. Keeps the team disciplined. MVP of the IEM Kraków win over paiN.
- **paiN — biguzera (captain):** Experienced leader but not a traditional IGL in the same sense. More of a veteran voice than tactical mastermind.
- **Tactical Edge: Aurora (MAJ3R)** — MAJ3R's structured approach gives Aurora better mid-round adaptability. paiN rely more on individual plays.

## 6. Recent Form

### Aurora Recent Results (Jan-Feb 2026)

| Date | Opponent | Score | Event | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feb 14 | FUT | 1-2 (L) | PGL Cluj-Napoca R1 | UPSET — FUT won 6/6 pistols, dziugss/lauNX starred |
| Feb 6 | FURIA | 0-2 (L) | IEM Kraków Playoffs | Lost to eventual contender |
| Feb 3 | Vitality | L | IEM Kraków Playoffs | Lost to #1 team |
| Jan 30 | paiN | 2-0 (W) | IEM Kraków Stage 1 | Dominant: Mirage 13-7, Overpass 13-6 |
| Jan 28 | PARIVISION | W | IEM Kraków Stage 1 | Advanced through Swiss |
| Jan 27 | GamerLegion | 2-0 (W) | IEM Kraków Stage 1 | woxic 1.57 rating |
| Jan 12 | HOTU | W | BLAST Bounty 2026 | soulfly debut match |

**Form Assessment: MIXED — Trending Cold**
- Aurora had a strong IEM Kraków showing (5th-6th) but are coming off TWO consecutive losses (Vitality/FURIA in playoffs, then FUT upset in Round 1 here).
- The FUT loss is concerning — losing to a lower-ranked team, with FUT winning all 6 pistols. Could indicate mental fragility or poor preparation.
- However, Aurora's IEM Kraków run showed their ceiling is high (dominated paiN 2-0, beat GamerLegion, PARIVISION).
- soulfly is still relatively new (joined Dec 27) — chemistry is building but not yet cemented.

### paiN Recent Results (Jan-Feb 2026)

| Date | Opponent | Score | Event | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Feb 14 | The MongolZ | 1-2 (L) | PGL Cluj-Napoca R1 | Won map 1 (13-7), then collapsed: lost 13-3, 13-1 |
| Jan 30 | Aurora | 0-2 (L) | IEM Kraków Stage 1 | Dominated: Mirage 7-13, Overpass 6-13 |
| Jan 29 | B8 | 2-0 (W) | IEM Kraków Stage 1 | Clean win over weaker opposition |
| Jan 27 | Astralis | 0-2 (L) | IEM Kraków Stage 1 | Lost to opening round |

**Form Assessment: COLD — Struggling**
- paiN's Round 1 loss was brutal. They won map 1 against The MongolZ 13-7, then completely collapsed losing 3-13 and 1-13. That's a mental breakdown.
- Their IEM Kraków was poor: lost to Astralis and Aurora, only beat B8 (weak team). Eliminated 9th-12th.
- vsm and piriajr are new additions for 2026 — the roster still finding its identity at the highest level.
- Only bright spot: nqz stepping up (1.19 avg rating at PGL Cluj).

## 7. Head-to-Head History

| Date | Event | Winner | Score | Maps |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jan 30, 2026 | IEM Kraków 2026 Stage 1 | **Aurora** | **2-0** | Mirage 13-7, Overpass 13-6 |
| Nov 12, 2023 | CCT Online Finals #4 | **paiN** | **2-1** | (Older roster, different era) |

**IEM Kraków Veto (Jan 30):**
1. paiN banned Anubis
2. Aurora banned Ancient
3. paiN picked Mirage → **Aurora won 13-7**
4. Aurora picked Overpass → **Aurora won 13-6**
5. paiN banned Inferno
6. Aurora banned Nuke
7. Dust2 (decider, not played)

**Map-Level H2H:**
| Map | Aurora Wins | paiN Wins |
|---|---|---|
| Overpass | 2 | 0 |
| Mirage | 1 (recent) | 2 (older) |
| Anubis | 0 | 1 (older) |

**H2H Pattern:** Aurora has decisively won the recent matchup. The 2-0 at IEM Kraków was comprehensive — Aurora won paiN's OWN map pick (Mirage 13-7) which is psychologically devastating. paiN's only H2H win was in 2023 with a completely different roster.

## 8. Tournament Context

- **Event:** PGL Cluj-Napoca 2026 — $625,000 prize pool
- **Stage:** Swiss Round 2 (0-1 Bracket)
- **Format:** BO3 (all Swiss rounds are BO3)
- **Stakes:** CRITICAL — Both teams are 0-1. The loser drops to 0-2 and is one loss away from elimination. The winner stays alive at 1-1 with room to recover.
- **Elimination:** 3 losses = eliminated from Swiss stage
- **Advancement:** 3 wins = advance to single-elimination playoffs
- **Seeding:** Buchholz system used from Round 2 onward
- **Crowd Factor:** LAN event at BT Arena. Neither team has a home crowd advantage (Turkish vs Brazilian team in Romania), but LAN environment favors Aurora who performed well at recent LANs.

**Pressure Analysis:**
- Both teams NEED this win. An 0-2 hole in Swiss is extremely difficult to climb out of (need to win 3 straight).
- Aurora have more LAN experience at this level and showed composure in their IEM Kraków run.
- paiN are under more pressure: they got humiliated in the second half of their MongolZ series (3+1 rounds across 2 maps) AND lost 0-2 to Aurora just 2 weeks ago. Double demons to fight.

│
├── paiN
│   ├── MENTAL STATE: Collapsed after winning map 1 vs MongolZ (13-7 → 3-13, 1-13)
│   ├── Roster chemistry: vsm and piriajr are new signings, still gelling

│   ├── IEM Kraków: poor showing (9th-12th, only beat B8)
│   └── LAN inexperience at top level for new players (vsm, piriajr)
│
└── X-FACTORS
    ├── ✅ Aurora: XANTARES on LAN — "wallhack" reads, can single-handedly win rounds
    ├── ✅ Aurora: Wicadia's ceiling — if he hits 1.70+ rating form, it's over
    ├── ⚠️ paiN: nqz stepping up — 1.19 rating at PGL, could carry if on form
    ├── ⚠️ paiN: Desperation factor — 0-2 = near elimination, nothing to lose mentality
    ├── ⚠️ Pistol rounds — FUT won 6/6 vs Aurora; if paiN can replicate, it changes everything
    └── ⚠️ 2-week demo review — paiN have had time to study the IEM Kraków loss
```

## 10. Series Prediction

### Predicted Maps
- **Map 1: Overpass (Aurora pick)** → **Aurora wins 13-7**
- **Map 2: Mirage (paiN pick)** → **Aurora wins 13-10**
- **Map 3: Dust2 (Decider)** → Not needed

### Series Result: Aurora wins 2-0
### Confidence: MEDIUM-HIGH

### Most Likely Scenarios

| Probability | Scenario | Reasoning |
|---|---|---|
| **40%** | **Aurora 2-0** | Aurora's Overpass is dominant, and they already beat paiN on Mirage. With paiN's mental state fragile after MongolZ collapse, a repeat sweep is the most likely outcome. |
| **30%** | **Aurora 2-1** | paiN wins their Mirage pick with adjusted tactics from 2-week review, but Aurora takes Overpass and the Dust2 decider on firepower (woxic/XANTARES). |
| **18%** | **paiN 2-1** | paiN wins Mirage, upsets on Dust2 decider (volatile map). Requires nqz to have a monster game and Aurora to tilt after losing their momentum. |
| **10%** | **paiN 2-0** | paiN somehow wins both Overpass AND Mirage. Requires Aurora to be completely tilted from Round 1 FUT loss and paiN to have a career day. Very unlikely. |
| **2%** | **Other** | Unexpected map veto changes, stand-in player, technical issues, etc. |

### Key Deciding Factors (Ranked)

1. **Aurora's Overpass dominance** — If Aurora takes Map 1 as expected, the pressure on paiN to win their own Mirage pick becomes immense.
2. **paiN's mental state** — Coming off a historic collapse (winning map 1 then losing 3+1 rounds in 2 maps), and already 0-2 in recent H2H vs Aurora. Confidence could be shattered.
3. **XANTARES factor** — On LAN, in a must-win match, XANTARES is one of the most dangerous players in the world. His aim on Mirage mid and Overpass connector is often the difference.
4. **Pistol rounds** — Aurora's pistol round issues (lost 6/6 vs FUT) are a concern. If paiN can win pistols, they steal 4-6 free rounds per series.
5. **woxic vs nqz AWP duel** — woxic's aggressive style should dominate on Overpass and Dust2, but nqz is more reliable on CT-side Mirage.

### Bottom Line

Aurora are the significantly better team on paper (higher ranking, stronger individual players, deeper map pool) and have recent H2H dominance (2-0 sweep just 2 weeks ago). paiN's only path to victory is through Mirage (their pick) and hope for a Dust2 decider where anything can happen.

The main concern for Aurora is their **form** — they're on a 2-match losing streak and lost all 6 pistol rounds vs FUT. If they bring their IEM Kraków level (where they dominated paiN), this should be a comfortable 2-0. If they bring their Round 1 level (sloppy, pistol issues), paiN has a window.

**Prediction: Aurora 2-0 (70% probability Aurora wins the series)**

## LIVE MATCH UPDATE (Feb 15, 2026)

### Series Score: 1-1 (heading to Map 3 decider)

**Map 1: Nuke — paiN wins 13-10**
- SURPRISE: Nuke was played instead of being banned by Aurora
- paiN took the CT-heavy map and converted their CT side effectively
- Aurora managed 10 rounds but couldn't close the gap
- **Veto prediction MISS** — I predicted Aurora would ban Nuke

**Map 2: Anubis — Aurora wins 13-7**
- Aurora dominated on their best map as expected
- **Key note:** paiN did NOT permaban Anubis this time (unlike IEM Kraków)
- Aurora's Anubis strength confirmed — comfortable 13-7 win
- **Veto prediction partially validated** — Anubis is still Aurora's power map

**Map 3: Dust2 (DECIDER) — IN PROGRESS / UPCOMING**
- As predicted, Dust2 ends up as the decider
- This is the ultimate aim duel map — woxic vs nqz at mid doors
- Dust2 is T-sided and volatile — anything can happen
- paiN has momentum from winning Map 1; Aurora has composure from equalizing on Map 2

### Veto Analysis — What Actually Happened

The veto was significantly different from IEM Kraków:
- paiN **did NOT ban Anubis** — bold change, but they still lost it 7-13
- Aurora **did NOT ban Nuke** — risky choice that cost them Map 1
- Both teams changed their approach from 2 weeks ago, but the core dynamics held (Aurora strong on Anubis, vulnerable on Nuke)

### Map 3 Preview: Dust2 Decider

| Factor | Aurora | paiN |
|---|---|---|
| AWP (mid doors) | woxic — aggressive flicks | nqz — positional, stepping up this tournament |
| Firepower | XANTARES + Wicadia | biguzera + vsm |
| Momentum | Equalized from 0-1 down | Lost Map 2 after winning Map 1 |
| Mental state | Confident after Anubis dominant | MongolZ Dust2 PTSD (lost 1-13 in R1) |
| Side preference | Slight T-side advantage for Dust2 | Need to overcome their R1 Dust2 collapse |

**Decider Prediction:** Aurora slight favorites (55-45) on Dust2 based on:
1. Superior individual firepower (XANTARES + woxic on an aim map)
2. paiN's Dust2 demons from 1-13 loss to MongolZ in Round 1
3. Aurora's momentum from dominating Map 2

**But:** Dust2 is the most volatile map in the pool. paiN winning Map 1 shows they're capable of competing. If nqz continues his form (1.19 avg at PGL), this could go either way.
