## 2. Team Overview

| Metric | FaZe | PARIVISION | Edge |
|--------|------|------------|------|
| HLTV Ranking | #9 | #6 | PARIVISION |
| PGL Cluj Record | 1-1 (beat Heroic 2-0, lost to Falcons 1-2) | 1-1 (lost to MOUZ 1-2, beat G2 2-1) | Even |
| Win Rate (3mo) | 57% (25W-19L, 44 maps) | 66% (35W-18L, 53 maps) | PARIVISION |
| Star Player Rating | frozen 1.16, Twistzz 1.11 | Jame 1.08 | FaZe |
| Recent Achievement | 2nd StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 | 1st BLAST Bounty 2026 S1 | Even |
| Odds | ~2.20 (underdog) | ~1.62 (favorite) | PARIVISION |

**Summary:** PARIVISION enters as the favorite with a deeper map pool and better recent win rate. FaZe has superior individual firepower through frozen and Twistzz but has been inconsistent, getting demolished 4-13 on Ancient by Falcons in R2. PARIVISION showed resilience beating G2 2-1 after losing R1 to MOUZ. Both teams are in a must-win mentality — a loss puts them at 1-2 and on elimination watch.

## 3. Map Pool Analysis

### Map Pool Matrix (Last 3 Months)

| Map | FaZe Win% | FaZe Maps | PRV Win% | PRV Maps | Advantage |
|-----|-----------|-----------|----------|----------|-----------|
| **Nuke** | **70%** | 10 | N/A | 0 (permaban) | FaZe |
| **Dust2** | 62% | 8 | **83%** | 12 | **PARIVISION** |
| **Inferno** | 60% | 10 | 55% | — | FaZe |
| **Ancient** | 57% | 7 | 60% | 10 | Slight PARIVISION |
| **Overpass** | 50% | 8 | 40% | — | FaZe |
| **Mirage** | 33% | 6 | **70%** | 10 | **PARIVISION** |
| **Anubis** | 0% | 1 | — | — | Unknown |

### Map Classification

```
FAZE MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Mirage (33% — always banned at PGL Cluj)
├── BEST MAPS: Nuke (70%, 10 maps) — but gets banned by opponents often
├── COMFORTABLE: Dust2 (62%), Inferno (60%)
├── AVERAGE: Ancient (57%), Overpass (50%)
└── WEAK: Anubis (0%, 1 map — but FaZe picked it vs Falcons, may be practicing)

PARIVISION MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Nuke (never played, always banned)
├── BEST MAPS: Dust2 (83%, 12 maps — elite level), Mirage (70%, 10 maps)
├── COMFORTABLE: Ancient (60%, 10 maps), Inferno (55%)
├── AVERAGE: —
└── WEAK: Overpass (40% — got destroyed 3-13 by MOUZ on it)
```

**Key Insight:** PARIVISION has a deeper and more dominant map pool. Their Dust2 (83%) is near-unbeatable, and Mirage (70%) is strong. FaZe's best map (Nuke 70%) is PARIVISION's permaban, neutralizing FaZe's biggest weapon. This gives PARIVISION a structural advantage in the veto.

## 4. PGL Cluj-Napoca Veto History

### FaZe's Vetoes at PGL Cluj

| Round | Opponent | Ban 1 | Pick | Ban 2 | Result |
|-------|----------|-------|------|-------|--------|
| R1 vs Heroic | **FaZe ban Mirage** | FaZe pick Ancient | FaZe ban Dust2 | **Won 2-0** (Overpass 13-5, Ancient 13-9) |
| R2 vs Falcons | **FaZe ban Mirage** | FaZe pick Anubis | FaZe ban Inferno | **Lost 1-2** (Anubis 9-13, Dust2 13-11, Ancient 4-13) |

**FaZe pattern:** Always bans Mirage first. Picked Ancient in R1 (won), picked Anubis in R2 (lost — surprising choice). Lost badly on Ancient decider vs Falcons (4-13).

### PARIVISION's Vetoes at PGL Cluj

| Round | Opponent | Ban 1 | Pick | Ban 2 | Result |
|-------|----------|-------|------|-------|--------|
| R1 vs MOUZ | **PRV ban Nuke** | PRV pick Dust2 | PRV ban Ancient | **Lost 1-2** (Dust2 13-7 W, Inferno 7-13 L, Overpass 3-13 L) |
| R2 vs G2 | **PRV ban Nuke** | PRV pick Mirage | PRV ban Ancient | **Won 2-1** (Mirage 8-13 L, Inferno 13-8 W, Dust2 13-4 W) |

**PARIVISION pattern:** Always bans Nuke first. Picks Dust2 or Mirage. Banned Ancient both times (interesting — 60% WR but still avoids it). Dominant on Dust2 decider (13-4 vs G2). Lost badly on Overpass (3-13 vs MOUZ).

---

## 5. Predicted Map Veto

**BO3 Veto Process:**

```
1. BAN: FaZe bans Mirage
   → Permaban. 33% win rate, PARIVISION's 2nd best map (70%). No-brainer.

2. BAN: PARIVISION bans Nuke
   → Permaban. Never played it, always banned. FaZe's best map (70%).

3. PICK: FaZe picks Inferno
   → 60% win rate for FaZe. Solid, CT-sided map that rewards FaZe's
     individual skill. PARIVISION is only 55% here. FaZe avoided picking
     Ancient after the 4-13 trauma vs Falcons. Inferno is the safest pick.

4. PICK: PARIVISION picks Dust2
   → 83% win rate — their best and most dominant map. Won 13-7 vs MOUZ
     and 13-4 vs G2 at this very event. Near-automatic pick.

5. BAN: FaZe bans Anubis
   → 0% win rate (1 map). Despite picking it vs Falcons (and losing),
     too risky against a team like PARIVISION. Remove the wildcard.

6. BAN: PARIVISION bans Overpass
   → 40% win rate, got destroyed 3-13 by MOUZ on it. PARIVISION
     has banned Ancient in previous rounds, but Overpass is objectively
     worse. Could also ban Ancient — this is the 50/50 decision.

7. DECIDER: Ancient
   → FaZe 57% | PARIVISION 60%. Close matchup. PARIVISION has been
     banning Ancient at this event, suggesting some discomfort despite
     decent stats. FaZe won it vs Heroic (13-9) but got crushed vs
     Falcons (4-13).
```

**Alternative veto scenario:** PARIVISION bans Ancient (as they've done twice already) instead of Overpass, making the decider Overpass — which would favor FaZe (50% vs 40%). This is a realistic possibility and would shift the series toward FaZe.

## 6. Map-by-Map Breakdown

### Map 1: Inferno (FaZe Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- FaZe: 60% win rate (6/10 maps, last 3 months)
- PARIVISION: ~55% win rate; won 13-8 vs G2 on it, lost 7-13 vs MOUZ

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Inferno is CT-sided (average ~55% CT rounds)
- Banana control and B-site utility are crucial
- FaZe's structured play under karrigan suits CT-side Inferno

**Key Players:**
- FaZe: frozen (star rifler, aggressive entries), Twistzz (anchor positions)
- PARIVISION: Jame (AWP holds from B/pit), zweih (unknown on this map)

**H2H on This Map:** No direct history.

**Predicted Score:** FaZe wins **13-10**
**Confidence:** Medium
**Key Factor:** FaZe's CT-side discipline under karrigan should give them the edge. PARIVISION's T-side Inferno looked poor vs MOUZ (only 5 T rounds). If FaZe builds a strong CT half, they close it out.

---

### Map 2: Dust2 (PARIVISION Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- FaZe: 62% win rate (5/8 maps, last 3 months)
- PARIVISION: **83% win rate** (10/12 maps, last 3 months)

**PGL Cluj Performance:**
- PARIVISION won Dust2 13-7 vs MOUZ (R1) and 13-4 vs G2 (R2) — dominant
- FaZe won Dust2 13-11 vs Falcons (R2) — competitive but not dominant

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Dust2 is T-sided (fastest rotations, aim-heavy)
- Favors teams with strong individual aimers
- PARIVISION's Dust2 is built around systematic T-side executes

**Key Players:**
- PARIVISION: Jame's AWP on Dust2 mid doors is iconic
- FaZe: broky needs to match Jame's mid control, frozen's entries are critical

**Predicted Score:** PARIVISION wins **13-8**
**Confidence:** High
**Key Factor:** PARIVISION's Dust2 is elite-tier at 83%. They've been dominant on it at this event specifically. FaZe is decent but not on the same level. Jame's AWP mid control on Dust2 is a tactical nightmare.

---

### Map 3: Ancient (Decider)

**Historical Performance:**
- FaZe: 57% win rate (4/7 maps, last 3 months)
- PARIVISION: 60% win rate (6/10 maps, last 3 months)

**PGL Cluj Performance:**
- FaZe won Ancient 13-9 vs Heroic (R1 pick) — but lost 4-13 vs Falcons (R2 decider)
- PARIVISION: Banned Ancient in both R1 and R2 — hasn't played it here

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Ancient is CT-sided; A-site takes require precise utility, B-site is tight
- CT-side rotations through cave/mid are crucial
- Favors disciplined, structured teams

**Key Players:**
- FaZe: frozen's aggression on B-site, Twistzz's clutch ability
- PARIVISION: Jame's passive AWP style suits CT Ancient perfectly

**Red Flag:** FaZe's 4-13 Ancient loss to Falcons is concerning — they completely collapsed. However, Falcons are arguably a tougher opponent. PARIVISION has been actively avoiding this map at the event, which suggests preparation concerns.

**Predicted Score:** PARIVISION wins **13-11**
**Confidence:** Low (could go either way)
**Key Factor:** This is a coin-flip map. PARIVISION has the statistical edge but has been avoiding it. FaZe has experience on it but showed massive variance (13-9 win vs 4-13 loss). If FaZe starts CT and builds a 8-4 or better half, they can close. If they start T and fall behind early, the Falcons trauma could resurface.

## 7. Player Matchups

### Star Player Comparison

| Player | Team | Rating | Age | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|-----|------|-------|
| **frozen** | FaZe | 1.16 | 23 | Rifler/Star | Highest-rated player in this matchup |
| **Twistzz** | FaZe | 1.11 | 26 | Rifler | Veteran aim, clutch player |
| **Jame** | PRV | 1.08 | 27 | AWPer | Passive AWP, clutch god, team captain |
| **broky** | FaZe | 1.01 | 25 | AWPer | Solid but not flashy |
| **BELCHONOKK** | PRV | 0.98 | 22 | Rifler | Steady support |
| **karrigan** | FaZe | 0.87 | 35 | IGL | Low fragging but elite tactics |

### AWP Matchup: broky vs Jame

- **broky** (1.01 rating) — Aggressive AWP, takes early peeks, Major champion pedigree. Currently in a statistical slump.
- **Jame** (1.08 rating) — Legendary passive AWPer. "Jame time" save economy, clutch-heavy playstyle. Won IEM Rio Major with Outsiders. Recently won BLAST Bounty 2026 S1.
- **Edge: Jame** — Higher rated, more impactful, and his passive AWP style on CT sides is extremely effective on maps like Dust2 and Ancient.

### IGL Comparison: karrigan vs Jame

- **karrigan** — Arguably the greatest IGL of all time. Adaptive, reads opponents mid-game, maximizes individual talent. But at 35, his fragging is a significant liability (0.87 rating).
- **Jame** — Primary AWPer AND captain (not a traditional IGL). Known for structured, methodical play with heavy save rounds. dastan (coach) likely handles tactical depth.
- **Tactical Edge: karrigan** — Pure tactical knowledge and mid-game adjustments are karrigan's forte. FaZe's ability to adapt between maps in a BO3 is their hidden strength.

### X-Factor: zweih

zweih joined PARIVISION just 6 weeks ago from Spirit. Had a **1.61 rated debut** at BLAST Bounty qualifier — explosive but a tiny sample. His integration is the biggest unknown. If he performs at even 80% of his debut level, PARIVISION gets a massive firepower boost. If he reverts to his inconsistent Spirit form, PARIVISION loses a key piece.

## 8. Recent Form at PGL Cluj-Napoca

### FaZe (1-1)

| Round | Opponent | Score | Maps |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| R1 | Heroic (#22) | **W 2-0** | Overpass 13-5, Ancient 13-9 |
| R2 | Falcons (#4) | **L 1-2** | Anubis 9-13 (FaZe pick!), Dust2 13-11, Ancient 4-13 |

**Form Assessment: Mixed**
- Dominant 2-0 vs a weaker Heroic, showing FaZe can steamroll lesser teams
- Got outclassed by Falcons, especially on the Ancient decider (4-13 blowout)
- Concerning: FaZe picked Anubis (0% WR) and lost it — questionable veto decision
- Positive: Won Dust2 13-11 vs Falcons even on opponent's pick — Dust2 is competitive

### PARIVISION (1-1)

| Round | Opponent | Score | Maps |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| R1 | MOUZ (#3) | **L 1-2** | Dust2 13-7 (PRV pick), Inferno 7-13, Overpass 3-13 |
| R2 | G2 (#8) | **W 2-1** | Mirage 8-13 (PRV pick), Inferno 13-8, Dust2 13-4 |

**Form Assessment: Resilient**
- Lost R1 to MOUZ but showed their Dust2 strength (13-7 win)
- Bounced back impressively in R2, beating G2 2-1 despite losing their own map pick
- Dominant Dust2 decider vs G2 (13-4) shows they thrive in pressure moments
- Concerning: Lost own map pick in both series (Dust2 R1 was a win, but Mirage 8-13 vs G2 was a loss)
- Their Overpass collapse (3-13 vs MOUZ) and Inferno loss (7-13 vs MOUZ) show vulnerability on non-comfort maps

## 9. Head-to-Head History

No recent direct matchups between FaZe and PARIVISION found in the data. These teams occupy different circuits — FaZe is a traditional EU/international powerhouse while PARIVISION comes from the CIS scene. The Budapest Major 2025 had both teams but in different brackets (FaZe faced Spirit, PARIVISION faced NAVI).

**This is their first meaningful BO3 encounter.** No map tendencies or psychological edge to extract from H2H. Both teams go in blind on opponent-specific preparation.

---

## 10. Tournament Context

- **Event:** PGL Cluj-Napoca 2026 (Major)
- **Stage:** Swiss Round 3 — 1-1 Bracket
- **Stakes:** Winner goes to 2-1 (one win from playoffs). Loser drops to 1-2 (one loss from elimination).
- **Pressure Level:** HIGH — This is effectively the swing match. Win here and you're in a comfortable position. Lose and you're one match from going home.
- **Crowd Factor:** LAN in Romania. Neither team has a home crowd advantage, but PARIVISION's CIS fanbase travels well.
- **Format Note:** All Swiss rounds are BO3, which favors teams with deeper map pools (advantage PARIVISION).

## 11. Red Flags & X-Factors

```
RED FLAGS:
├── FaZe
│   ├── Ancient collapse vs Falcons (4-13) — confidence damage?
│   ├── Picked Anubis (0% WR) vs Falcons and lost — erratic veto
│   ├── karrigan at 0.87 rating — significant fragging deficit
│   ├── jcobbb still integrating (5 months) — unknown in high-pressure situations
│   └── Mirage permaban limits their pool severely
├── PARIVISION
│   ├── zweih is VERY new (6 weeks) — integration risk in Major pressure
│   ├── Lost own map pick in both PGL Cluj series (concerning pattern)
│   ├── Overpass is unplayable (3-13 collapse vs MOUZ)
│   ├── Qikert benching — internal dynamics unknown
│   └── MOUZ loss showed they can crumble on non-comfort maps

X-FACTORS:
├── karrigan's mid-game adjustments — FaZe's biggest intangible asset
├── zweih's form — if he plays like his BLAST Bounty debut, PARIVISION is terrifying
├── Jame's clutch ability in close maps — "Jame time" can swing overtime maps
├── frozen as FaZe's carry — if he goes off (1.20+ rating), FaZe can beat anyone
└── First-ever BO3 meeting — no scouting advantage for either side
```

## 12. Series Prediction: FaZe vs PARIVISION (BO3)

**Predicted Maps:**
- Map 1: Inferno (FaZe pick) → **FaZe wins 13-10**
- Map 2: Dust2 (PARIVISION pick) → **PARIVISION wins 13-8**
- Map 3: Ancient (Decider) → **PARIVISION wins 13-11**

**Series Result: PARIVISION wins 2-1**
**Confidence: Medium**

**Most Likely Scenarios:**

| Probability | Outcome | Reasoning |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **35%** | **PARIVISION 2-1** | FaZe wins Inferno pick, PRV dominates Dust2, Ancient decider goes to PRV through Jame clutches |
| 20% | PARIVISION 2-0 | PRV's map pool advantage overwhelms. If FaZe's Inferno doesn't hold, sweep incoming |
| 20% | FaZe 2-1 | frozen carries, karrigan out-tactics on decider, FaZe's experience in Major pressure pays off |
| 15% | FaZe 2-0 | FaZe's firepower peaks, frozen + Twistzz dominate. Unlikely but possible if PARIVISION's new lineup cracks under Major pressure |
| 10% | PARIVISION 2-1 (alt maps) | Different veto plays out — e.g., Overpass decider, Ancient pick instead |

**Key Series Swing Points:**
1. **FaZe's Inferno CT half** — If FaZe build a 9-3 or better CT half on their pick, they take Map 1 comfortably. If they only get 7-5, PARIVISION's T side can steal it.
2. **Dust2 margin** — A 13-16 loss for FaZe on Dust2 is fine (expected). But if FaZe somehow steals Dust2, the series is over.
3. **Ancient pistol rounds** — On a decider, each pistol round is worth ~3 rounds. The team winning both pistols likely wins the map.
4. **zweih under pressure** — His first Major decider map. If he freezes, FaZe capitalize. If he performs, PARIVISION's firepower is complete.

**Bottom Line:** PARIVISION's superior map pool and current form give them the edge. FaZe's individual talent (frozen, Twistzz) and karrigan's tactical brain keep them competitive, but their inconsistency at this event (2-0 steamroll then 1-2 collapse) is concerning. PARIVISION has shown they can beat elite teams (G2) and their Dust2 is near-guaranteed. The Ancient decider is the true coin flip — expect a close, intense map.

## 13. Prediction vs Market

| Outcome | My Probability | Polymarket | Edge | Signal |
|---------|---------------|------------|------|--------|
| FaZe ML | 35% | 39.5% | -4.5% | No Value (market overvalues FaZe) |
| PARIVISION ML | 65% | 60.5% | **+4.5%** | Slight lean PRV but below threshold |
| Map 1: FaZe | 55% | 37.0% | **+18.0%** | **STRONG VALUE** (FaZe's pick) |
| Map 1: PRV | 45% | 63.0% | -18.0% | Fade |
| Map 2: FaZe | 25% | 45.0% | -20.0% | Fade (PRV's Dust2 is elite) |
| Map 2: PRV | 75% | 55.0% | **+20.0%** | **STRONG VALUE** (PRV's Dust2) |
| Over 2.5 maps | 55% | 46.0% | **+9.0%** | **VALUE** (expect 2-1 series) |
| Under 2.5 maps | 45% | 54.0% | -9.0% | Fade |

**Value Plays:**
- **Map 1 FaZe Winner (37% → should be ~55%)** — If Inferno is FaZe's pick as predicted, the market is massively underpricing them. However, this market has only $12 volume, so the price is likely stale/thin. Proceed with caution on liquidity.
- **Map 2 PARIVISION Winner (55% → should be ~75%)** — PARIVISION's Dust2 is 83% WR and they've been dominant on it. The market at 55% is too low. Again, $0 volume — the market hasn't formed yet.
- **Over 2.5 maps (46% → should be ~55%)** — My prediction is 2-1 PARIVISION. Each team should win their own map pick, leading to a decider. Market leans 2-0 which seems aggressive given FaZe's Inferno strength. Low volume ($43) though.
- **ML is fairly priced** — My 65% PRV vs market's 60.5% is only a 4.5% edge, below the 5% threshold for actionable value.

**Market Efficiency Notes:**
- The ML market ($45K volume) is reasonably efficient and aligns with our analysis direction
- Individual map markets are essentially unpriced (near-zero volume) — the numbers shown are opening lines, not real market prices
- The Under 2.5 bias (54%) conflicts with the Map Handicap line (FaZe +1.5 at 67.5%), which implies the market actually thinks FaZe takes at least 1 map most of the time. This is internally inconsistent, likely due to thin markets

## LIVE UPDATE — Match In Progress

### Actual Veto

```
1. PARIVISION ban Nuke       (predicted: FaZe ban Mirage)     ❌
2. FaZe ban Dust2            (predicted: PARIVISION ban Nuke) ❌
3. PARIVISION pick Mirage    (predicted: FaZe pick Inferno)   ❌
4. FaZe pick Ancient         (predicted: PARIVISION pick D2)  ❌
5. FaZe ban Overpass         (predicted: FaZe ban Anubis)     ❌
6. PARIVISION ban Anubis     (predicted: PARIVISION ban OVP)  ❌
7. Decider: Inferno          (predicted: Decider Ancient)     ❌
```

**Veto Score: 0/7** — Complete miss. FaZe abandoned their Mirage permaban and banned Dust2 (PARIVISION's 83% map) instead. This forced PARIVISION to pick Mirage (70%) rather than Dust2 (83%). FaZe accepted playing on their 33% WR map to avoid PARIVISION's strongest weapon. Bold strategy.

### Game 1: Mirage (PARIVISION Pick) — FaZe 13-2

| Half | FaZe | PARIVISION | Side |
|------|------|------------|------|
| 1st | **10** | 2 | FaZe CT |
| 2nd | **3** | 0 | FaZe T |
| **Total** | **13** | **2** | **FaZe wins** |

**FaZe wins PARIVISION's own map pick 13-2.** Absolute demolition. FaZe dominated CT side (10-2) and then closed it immediately on T side (3-0). PARIVISION managed just 2 rounds total on their 70% WR map. FaZe's Mirage "33% WR" stat was clearly irrelevant — karrigan hard-prepared for this specific matchup.

**Series: FaZe leads 1-0**

### Game 2: Ancient (FaZe Pick) — PARIVISION 13-11

| Half | FaZe | PARIVISION | Side |
|------|------|------------|------|
| 1st (FaZe T) | **9** | 3 | FaZe dominates T-side |
| 2nd (FaZe CT) | 2 | **10** | PARIVISION 10-2 T-side comeback |
| **Total** | **11** | **13** | **PARIVISION wins** |

**PARIVISION pulls off a massive comeback!** FaZe led 9-3 at half on their T-side, but PARIVISION's T-side was devastating — 10-2 to overturn the deficit. FaZe's CT side completely collapsed, just like their Ancient loss to Falcons (4-13). Ancient CT-side is becoming a clear weakness for FaZe.

**Series: 1-1** — heading to the Inferno decider.

### Game 3: Inferno (Decider) — PARIVISION 13-9
