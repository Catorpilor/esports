## Actual Maps vs Prediction

| Map | Predicted | Actual | Score | Halves (G2 perspective) | Correct? |
|-----|-----------|--------|-------|-------------------------|----------|
| Map 1 | Mirage (G2 pick) → G2 13-7 | Inferno (paiN pick) → G2 13-10 | 13-10 | G2 CT 8-4, T 5-6 | ✅ Winner (predicted G2 wins Inferno 13-9) |
| Map 2 | Inferno/Dust2 → G2 wins | Mirage (G2 pick) → G2 13-9 | 13-9 | G2 CT 8-4, T 5-5 | ✅ Winner + close to predicted score (13-7) |
| Map 3 | Dust2 (decider) → G2 13-7 | Not played (2-0) | — | — | N/A |

**POTM: HeavyGod (G2)** — 1.06 rated player stepped up in the elimination match.

## Key Observations

**1. paiN picked Inferno — exactly as we theorized:**
Our analysis noted: "paiN's best strategic play is Inferno (exploiting G2's 20% WR)." paiN did exactly this. But G2 won 13-10 anyway — their 20% Inferno WR was misleading in this specific matchup. G2 had beat paiN 13-8 on Inferno in H2H (ESL Pro League S21), confirming **Principle #1 (H2H > Map Stats)**.

**2. paiN banned Dust2 instead of Anubis:**
Smart move by paiN — they were 14.3% on Dust2 and had been destroyed 2-13 and 4-13 on it at PGL Cluj. Banning their absolute worst map rather than a map with no data (Anubis 0-1) was rational. This shifted the decider to Anubis, but G2 never needed it.

**3. G2's CT side was dominant on both maps:**
- Inferno: G2 CT 8-4 (strong banana control)
- Mirage: G2 CT 8-4 (identical CT half)

G2 consistently won 8 CT rounds on both maps, building comfortable leads before switching sides. This contrasts with MOUZ's CT-side collapse vs VIT — G2 had no such weakness.

**4. paiN competed but couldn't close:**
Inferno 13-10 and Mirage 13-9 are respectable scores — paiN didn't collapse like they did vs MongolZ (1-13, 2-13) or Aurora (4-13). Elimination pressure (Principle #12) did elevate their performance, but G2's H2H dominance (now 6-0 → 8-0 maps) was too much.

## Series Prediction Assessment

| Prediction | Actual | Correct? |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Winner: G2** | **G2** | ✅ |
| **Scoreline: 2-0** | **2-0** | ✅ |
| G2 probability: 70% | G2 won | ✅ |
| G2 2-0 probability: 45% | G2 2-0 | ✅ (most likely scenario hit) |
| paiN picks Inferno | paiN picked Inferno | ✅ |
| G2 picks Mirage | G2 picked Mirage | ✅ |

## Market Call Assessment

| Market | Our Call | Polymarket | Actual | Correct? |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|----------|
| **G2 ML (78.5%)** | paiN Value at 30% | 78.5% G2 | ✅ G2 won 2-0 | ❌ Wrong — market was right, G2 was correctly priced (or underpriced!) |
| **Map 2 paiN (25.5%)** | paiN Value at 40% | 25.5% paiN | ❌ G2 won 13-9 | ❌ Wrong — G2 dominated their Mirage pick |
| **Over 2.5 (39%)** | Slight Value at 45% | 39% Over | ❌ Under hit (2-0) | ❌ Wrong — G2 swept |
| **Under 2.5 (61%)** | No Value | 61% Under | ✅ Under hit | ✅ Correct — no position recommended |

**Market Calls: 1/3** (only the "no position on Under" was correct by not taking a bad bet)

## Lessons Learned

**1. H2H dominance is the strongest predictor — even overrides map weakness:**
G2 had 20% Inferno WR overall, but the H2H on Inferno was G2 13-8 paiN. G2 won Inferno 13-10 here. When H2H is 6-0 maps and dominant on every surface, the "weaker" team has a psychological ceiling they can't break through. Principle #1 held perfectly.

**2. The market was right — our "paiN value" call was wrong:**
We called paiN ML at 21.5% as value (model said 30%). G2 won 2-0 convincingly. The market at 78.5% G2 was actually closer to reality than our 70%. When H2H is THIS lopsided (6-0 → 8-0 maps), the model should weight H2H even more heavily and reduce the underdog's probability. Principle #20 (Market Respect) applies: our 8.5% disagreement with the market was in the wrong direction.

**3. Elimination pressure has limits against H2H dominance:**
paiN played better than their PGL form (10 and 9 rounds vs prior collapses of 1, 2, 4 rounds). Elimination pressure DID elevate them (Principle #12). But it wasn't enough to overcome a team that has beaten them 8-0 in maps. Principle #12's boost has a ceiling when facing a historically dominant opponent.

**4. Sweep probability was correct this time (45%):**
After learning from the MOUZ-VIT backtest (Principle #24), we assigned 45% to G2 2-0 — and it hit. The adjusted sweep probability worked well here. Continue using 40-45% for sweep when favorite has strong H2H + opponent's pick is exploitable.
