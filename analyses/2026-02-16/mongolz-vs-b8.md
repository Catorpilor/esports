**Note:** Map 1, Map 2, O/U, and Handicap markets are all resolved. The match is **LIVE** heading to a Map 3 decider. Only the ML remains open.

**Market Insights:**
- **$1.14M ML volume** — massively traded market, very efficient pricing
- Pre-match MongolZ was favored (~55%), now live at 54.5% despite losing Map 2
- Map 1 (MongolZ won Ancient 13-9) and Map 2 (B8 won Mirage 13-7) are resolved
- Over 2.5 maps hit — as expected given both teams won their opponent's pick
- The ML at 54.5% MongolZ heading into a **Nuke decider is potentially mispriced** given MongolZ's 0% Nuke WR (see analysis below)

**HLTV Bookmaker Odds (pre-match):**
- MongolZ: ~1.60 | B8: ~2.20
- MongolZ was the moderate favorite pre-match

## 2. Team Overview

| Metric | The MongolZ | B8 | Edge |
|--------|-------------|-----|------|
| HLTV Ranking | #13 | #14 | Even |
| PGL Cluj Record | 1-1 (beat paiN 2-1, lost to VIT 1-2) | 1-1 (lost to FURIA 0-2, beat Heroic 2-0) | Even |
| Win Rate (3mo) | 45% (9W-11L, 20 maps) | N/A (API blocked) | Unknown |
| K/D Ratio (3mo) | 0.97 | N/A | Unknown |
| Star Player Rating | 910 (1.08) | kensizor (1.10) | Even |
| H2H | Won 2-0 (2024) | — | MongolZ (stale data) |

**Summary:** An extremely close matchup between two similarly-ranked teams (#13 vs #14). Neither team is dominant — MongolZ has a below-50% win rate (45%) and a sub-1.0 K/D. Both went 1-1 in the Swiss stage. The MongolZ beat paiN 2-1 (with a terrible Nuke loss) and lost to Vitality 1-2. B8 lost to FURIA 0-2 but swept Heroic 2-0. This is a genuine toss-up on paper.

## 4. Map Pool Analysis

### The MongolZ Map Stats (Last 3 Months)

| Map | Win% | Record | Notes |
|-----|------|--------|-------|
| **Mirage** | **66.7%** | 4-2 | Best map, picked at PGL Cluj |
| **Ancient** | **66.7%** | 2-1 ⚠️ | Small sample |
| **Inferno** | 50% | 1-1 ⚠️ | Tiny sample |
| **Dust2** | 33.3% | 2-4 | Below average |
| **Nuke** | **0%** | 0-3 | **DISASTER** — lost 4-13 (VIT), 7-13 (paiN), 2-13 (FURIA) |
| **Overpass** | N/A | 0 maps | Never played |
| **Anubis** | N/A | 0 maps | Never played |

### B8 PGL Cluj Performance (API blocked, manual data)

| Map | Result | Opponent | Score |
|-----|--------|----------|-------|
| Mirage | L | FURIA | 11-13 |
| Inferno | L | FURIA | 10-13 |
| Overpass | **W** | Heroic | 13-5 |
| Dust2 | **W** | Heroic | 13-4 |
| Ancient | L | MongolZ | 9-13 (this match) |

**Map Classification:**

```
THE MONGOLZ MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Anubis (never played, 0 data)
├── BEST MAPS: Mirage (66.7%, 6 maps), Ancient (66.7%, 3 maps ⚠️)
├── COMFORTABLE: —
├── AVERAGE: Inferno (50%, 2 maps ⚠️)
├── WEAK: Dust2 (33.3%, 6 maps)
└── DISASTER: Nuke (0%, 3 maps — historically terrible)

B8 MAP POOL (estimated from PGL Cluj):
├── PERMABAN: Inferno (banned vs MongolZ despite competitive vs FURIA)
├── BEST MAPS: Overpass (13-5 vs Heroic), Dust2 (13-4 vs Heroic)
├── COMFORTABLE: Mirage (11-13 vs FURIA — competitive)
├── AVERAGE: Ancient (picked but lost 9-13)
└── UNKNOWN: Nuke, Anubis (no data at event)
```

**CRITICAL: The Nuke decider is a catastrophe for MongolZ.** They are 0-3 (0%) on Nuke in the last 3 months with combined scores of 4-13, 7-13, and 2-13. They haven't been even remotely competitive on this map. Their average Nuke score is **4.3 rounds per map.**

## 5. Head-to-Head History

### H2H: MongolZ 2-0 B8 (from 2024)

| Date | Event | Map | Winner | Score |
|------|-------|-----|--------|-------|
| 2024 | Elisa Masters Espoo | Inferno | MongolZ | 13-8 |
| 2024 | Elisa Masters Espoo | Nuke | MongolZ | 13-3 |

**H2H Assessment:** Only 2 maps of data from 2024 — too stale and small to be meaningful. MongolZ won both including Nuke 13-3 — but that was a completely different meta and roster context. MongolZ's current Nuke is 0-3, so the 2024 result is irrelevant.

---

## 6. PGL Cluj-Napoca Tournament Form

### The MongolZ (1-1)

| Round | Opponent | Score | Maps |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| R1 | paiN (#15) | **W 2-1** | Nuke 7-13 L, Mirage 13-1 W, Dust2 13-2 W |
| R2 | Vitality (#1) | **L 1-2** | Mirage 13-9 W (!), Inferno 1-13 L, Anubis 9-13 L |

**Pattern:** Mirage is their go-to (won 3, lost 0 at PGL Cluj until today). Lost Nuke badly to paiN. Beat Vitality on Mirage 13-9 — impressive. Got destroyed on Inferno 1-13 and lost Anubis 9-13 to VIT.

### B8 (1-1)

| Round | Opponent | Score | Maps |
|-------|----------|-------|------|
| R1 | FURIA (#5) | **L 0-2** | Mirage 11-13 L, Inferno 10-13 L |
| R2 | Heroic (#22) | **W 2-0** | Overpass 13-5 W, Dust2 13-4 W |

**Pattern:** Competitive in losses (11-13, 10-13 vs a top-5 team). Dominant when winning (13-5, 13-4 vs Heroic). B8 is a team that either shows up big or falls just short.

## 7. Actual Veto (Match is LIVE)

```
1. B8 ban Inferno
2. MongolZ ban Anubis
3. B8 pick Ancient
4. MongolZ pick Mirage
5. MongolZ ban Overpass   — Removed B8's strong map (13-5 vs Heroic)
6. B8 ban Dust2           — Removed MongolZ's weak map... odd choice
7. DECIDER: Nuke          — MongolZ's 0% WR disaster map
```

**Veto Analysis:**
- B8 banned Inferno (banned vs MongolZ specifically, even though they played it vs FURIA)
- MongolZ banned Anubis (no data, standard)
- B8 picked Ancient — lost 9-13. A surprise loss on their own pick.
- MongolZ picked Mirage — their best map (66.7%). Lost 7-13. B8 dominated with an 11-1 CT half.
- MongolZ banned Overpass — smart, B8 won 13-5 on it vs Heroic
- B8 banned Dust2 — perhaps fearing MongolZ on it, even though MongolZ is only 33.3%
- **Nuke decider** — This is a nightmare for MongolZ (0-3, 0% WR)

## 8. LIVE UPDATE — Match In Progress

### Game 1: Ancient (B8 Pick) — MongolZ 13-9

| Half | MongolZ | B8 | Side |
|------|---------|-----|------|
| 1st (MongolZ CT) | **9** | 3 | MongolZ dominant CT |
| 2nd (MongolZ T) | 4 | **6** | B8 CT side stronger |
| **Total** | **13** | **9** | **MongolZ wins** |

MongolZ wins B8's map pick. Strong CT side (9-3) gave them the foundation. B8's CT side was better in the second half (6-4) but the deficit was too large.

### Game 2: Mirage (MongolZ Pick) — B8 13-7

| Half | MongolZ | B8 | Side |
|------|---------|-----|------|
| 1st (MongolZ T) | 1 | **11** | B8 CT side DOMINANT |
| 2nd (MongolZ CT) | **6** | 2 | MongolZ CT recovery |
| **Total** | **7** | **13** | **B8 wins** |

B8 destroys MongolZ's best map. An 11-1 CT half was devastating — MongolZ managed just 1 T round. The CT switch was better (6-2 MongolZ) but far too late. MongolZ's Mirage streak at PGL Cluj is broken.

### Series: 1-1 → Nuke Decider

**THE CRITICAL QUESTION: Can MongolZ win Nuke despite 0% WR?**

MongolZ Nuke record (last 3 months):
- vs Vitality: **4-13** (PGL Cluj R2)
- vs paiN: **7-13** (PGL Cluj R1)
- vs FURIA: **2-13** (IEM Kraków)
- Average rounds won: **4.3 per map**

The one positive: H2H shows MongolZ beat B8 on Nuke 13-3 at Elisa Masters 2024. But that was over a year ago.

B8 has no Nuke data from PGL Cluj (haven't played it). This is truly unknown territory for B8 at this event.

**Nuke Outlook:**
- MongolZ at 0% Nuke is alarming, but per Principle #12 (Elimination Pressure), teams can elevate in must-win scenarios.
- However, 0-3 with scores of 4-13, 7-13, 2-13 is more than a bad streak — it suggests a systemic inability to play Nuke.
- B8 is the unknown quantity. If they have ANY competent Nuke preparation, they should be favored.
- **MongolZ win probability on Nuke: ~30-35%** (elevated from raw 0% by elimination pressure and B8's unknown Nuke)
- **B8 win probability on Nuke: ~65-70%**

### Updated ML Assessment

With the Nuke decider:
- **Polymarket ML: MongolZ 54.5%** — This seems OVERPRICED for MongolZ given the Nuke decider
- **My assessment: MongolZ ~35%, B8 ~65%** on the Nuke decider
- **Potential VALUE on B8 ML at 45.5%** if you believe the Nuke stats

However, caution per Principle #11 (H2H Has Limits) and #12 (Elimination Pressure): MongolZ could play above their 0% baseline in a do-or-die map. And B8's Nuke is completely unscouted.

## 9. Player Matchups

| Player | Team | Rating | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| **kensizor** | B8 | 1.10 | Highest-rated player in this matchup |
| **910** | MongolZ | 1.08 | MongolZ's star |
| **npl** | B8 | 1.07 | Strong second carry |
| **mzinho** | MongolZ | 1.06 | Consistent |
| **cobrazera** | MongolZ | 1.04 | Solid |
| **esenthial** | B8 | 1.00 | Average |
| **s1zzi** | B8 | 0.99 | New player |
| **alex666** | B8 | 0.97 | Support |
| **bLitz** | MongolZ | 0.95 | AWP/IGL |
| **Techno** | MongolZ | 0.89 | Liability |

**AWP Matchup:** bLitz (0.95) vs npl (1.07, likely AWP). Edge to B8 — npl is significantly more impactful. On Nuke specifically, AWP play on outside/ramp is crucial.

## 10. Red Flags & X-Factors

```
RED FLAGS:
├── The MongolZ
│   ├── 0% Nuke WR (0-3) — average 4.3 rounds per map on Nuke
│   ├── Lost their own Mirage pick 7-13 — B8 found the blueprint
│   ├── Techno at 0.89 rating — significant drag on team performance
│   ├── Below 50% overall WR (45%) — not a strong team statistically
│   └── K/D ratio below 1.0 (0.97) — losing more aim duels than winning
├── B8
│   ├── Unknown Nuke — haven't played it at PGL Cluj
│   ├── headtr1ck benched — lost their former star player
│   ├── s1zzi is new — integration risk in a Major decider
│   ├── Lost to FURIA 0-2 in R1 — couldn't take a map off a top-5 team
│   └── Ancient pick backfired (9-13) — their pick didn't work

X-FACTORS:
├── MongolZ's 2024 Nuke H2H — Beat B8 13-3 on Nuke at Elisa Masters.
│   Ancient history but psychological edge if MongolZ remember it.
├── B8's Nuke preparation — Completely unknown. Could be a secret weapon
│   or a disaster. The mystery factor benefits B8.
├── MongolZ's "nothing to lose" mentality — Backed into Nuke (0% WR),
│   elimination pressure could unlock something unexpected.
├── Nuke's CT-sided nature — The team starting CT has a big advantage.
│   Pistol rounds are extra critical.
└── 910's carry potential — At 1.08, he's the one player who could
    single-handedly steal Nuke for MongolZ if he goes off.
```

## 11. Series Prediction

**Pre-match prediction (before live data):**
- MongolZ 55% / B8 45% — very close matchup between similarly-ranked teams

**Live-adjusted prediction (heading into Nuke decider):**
- **B8 wins Nuke: ~65%**
- **MongolZ wins Nuke: ~35%**

The Nuke decider massively favors B8. MongolZ's 0-3 (0%) Nuke with scores of 4-13, 7-13, 2-13 is not just bad — it's catastrophic. Even with elimination pressure elevation (~10-15%), they're still significant underdogs.

**B8 predicted to win 13-9 on Nuke.**

**Series Result: B8 wins 2-1**
**Confidence: Medium** (B8 Nuke is unscouted — could go either way if they're also bad on Nuke)

---

## 12. Prediction vs Market (LIVE)

| Outcome | My Probability | Polymarket (Live) | Edge | Signal |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|------|--------|
| MongolZ ML | 35% | 54.5% | **-19.5%** | **STRONG FADE** |
| B8 ML | 65% | 45.5% | **+19.5%** | **STRONG VALUE** |

**VALUE PLAY: B8 ML at 45.5% ($2.20 decimal odds)**

The market has MongolZ at 54.5% heading into a Nuke decider where MongolZ is 0-3 (0% WR) with an average of 4.3 rounds per map. This is a massive mispricing. Even accounting for:
- Elimination pressure (+10-15% adjustment)
- B8's unknown Nuke (could be bad too)
- MongolZ's 2024 H2H Nuke win (stale data)

...MongolZ should NOT be 54.5% on a map where they've been historically demolished. The market appears to be pricing the pre-match favorite without adjusting for the specific decider map.

**Risk:** B8's Nuke is completely unscouted. If they're equally bad on it, this becomes a coin flip. But "unknown" is still better than "proven 0%."
