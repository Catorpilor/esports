**HLTV Bookmaker Odds (average):**
- MOUZ: ~2.95 | Vitality: ~1.37
- Polymarket (3.17 / 1.46) is slightly softer on MOUZ vs bookmakers

**Market Insights:**
- Vitality is a heavy favorite at 68.5% — aligns with their #1 ranking and dominant form
- **Map 1 at 64% VIT** is close to the ML (68.5%) — market doesn't see much map pick differentiation
- **Map 2 at 60% VIT** is slightly lower than ML — market gives MOUZ a better shot on their own pick
- **Under 2.5 favored at 54%** — market leans toward a VIT 2-0 sweep
- **MOUZ +1.5 at 61.5%** — market fairly confident MOUZ takes at least 1 map (39% of the time this series is a sweep)
- Very high ML volume ($400K) and O/U volume ($241K) — these lines are well-tested and efficient
- Map-level markets have low volume — less reliable

## 2. Team Overview

| Metric | MOUZ | Vitality | Edge |
|--------|------|----------|------|
| HLTV Ranking | #4 | **#1** | **Vitality** |
| PGL Cluj Record | 2-0 (beat PRV 2-1, beat NAVI 2-0) | 2-0 (beat G2 2-1, beat MongolZ 2-1) | Even |
| Win Rate (3mo) | 58.6% (17W-12L, 29 maps) | **82.5%** (33W-7L, 40 maps) | **Vitality** |
| K/D Ratio (3mo) | 1.04 | **1.17** | **Vitality** |
| Star Player Rating | Spinx 1.14 | **ZywOo 1.40** | **Vitality** |
| Recent Achievement | 4th IEM Kraków 2026 | **1st IEM Kraków 2026, 1st StarLadder Major** | **Vitality** |
| H2H (current maps) | 10 | **25** | **Vitality (25-10)** |

**Summary:** This is a clash between the #1 team in the world and a strong #4. Vitality dominates in virtually every metric — higher ranking, superior win rate (82.5% vs 58.6%), better K/D, the best player in the world (ZywOo 1.40), reigning Major champion, and a crushing 25-10 H2H advantage on current active duty maps. MOUZ's path to victory is narrow: they need Inferno or Overpass (their comfort maps) and need ZywOo to have an off day.

## 3. Roster Breakdown

### MOUZ

| Player | Role | Rating (3mo) | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| **Spinx** | Rifler/Star | 1.14 | Highest-rated MOUZ player, consistent entry fragger |
| **xertioN** | Rifler | 1.08 | Young talent, solid support |
| **torzsi** | AWPer | 1.04 | Primary AWP, hybrid style |
| **Jimpphat** | Rifler | 1.02 | Young Finnish prodigy |
| **Brollan** | Rifler | 0.93 | **SLUMPING** — well below his career average |
| **sycrone** | Coach | — | Tactical mind behind MOUZ's system |

### Vitality

| Player | Role | Rating (3mo) | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------|-------|
| **ZywOo** | AWPer/Star | **1.40** | Best player in the world, generational talent |
| **flameZ** | Rifler | 1.14 | Aggressive entry, high impact |
| **ropz** | Rifler | 1.14 | Methodical lurker, clutch master |
| **mezii** | Rifler | 1.11 | Versatile, consistent support |
| **apEX** | IGL | 0.96 | Aggressive IGL, significantly higher fragging than most IGLs |
| **XTQZZZ** | Coach | — | One of the greatest CS coaches ever |

**Key Difference:** ZywOo at 1.40 is absurd — it's 0.26 higher than MOUZ's best player (Spinx 1.14). Vitality has four players above 1.10, while MOUZ has only one. The firepower gap is massive. Additionally, Brollan at 0.93 is a significant liability for MOUZ — he was once a superstar but is in a deep slump.

## 4. Map Pool Analysis

### Map Pool Matrix (Last 3 Months)

| Map | MOUZ Win% | Maps | VIT Win% | Maps | Advantage |
|-----|-----------|------|----------|------|-----------|
| **Dust2** | 42.9% | 7 | **100%** | 9 | **Vitality (massive)** |
| **Overpass** | **80%** | 5 | **100%** | 6 | **Vitality** (both strong) |
| **Inferno** | **71.4%** | 7 | 75% | 8 | Even (slight VIT) |
| **Nuke** | 33.3% | 3 ⚠️ | 66.7% | 6 | **Vitality** |
| **Mirage** | 40% | 5 | 50% | 6 | Slight Vitality |
| **Anubis** | N/A | 0 | **100%** | 3 ⚠️ | **Vitality** |
| **Ancient** | 100% | 1 ⚠️ | 100% | 1 ⚠️ | Unknown (both tiny) |

### Map Classification

```
MOUZ MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Dust2 (42.9% but VIT is 100% on it, H2H 1-7 — suicide map)
├── BEST MAPS: Overpass (80%, 5 maps), Inferno (71.4%, 7 maps)
├── COMFORTABLE: —
├── AVERAGE: Mirage (40%, 5 maps)
├── WEAK: Nuke (33.3%, 3 maps ⚠️)
└── UNKNOWN: Ancient (1 map), Anubis (0 maps)

VITALITY MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: None obvious — elite on everything
├── BEST MAPS: Dust2 (100%, 9 maps), Overpass (100%, 6 maps)
├── COMFORTABLE: Inferno (75%, 8 maps), Nuke (66.7%, 6 maps), Anubis (100%, 3 maps ⚠️)
├── AVERAGE: Mirage (50%, 6 maps) — their "weakest" map
└── UNKNOWN: Ancient (1 map)
```

**Critical Insight:** Vitality's map pool is historically deep — they have **zero weak maps**. Their "worst" is Mirage at 50%, which would be comfortable for most teams. MOUZ's only genuine strength maps are Overpass and Inferno, and Vitality is equal or better on both. MOUZ has no map pool advantage to exploit.

## 5. Head-to-Head History (CRITICAL)

### Overall H2H on Current Active Duty Maps: Vitality 25-10

| Map | VIT Wins | MOUZ Wins | VIT Edge? | Recent |
|-----|----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Dust2** | **7** | 1 | **VIT dominant (7-1)** | VIT 13-6 (IEM Kraków, Feb 2026) |
| **Mirage** | **6** | 3 | **VIT leads (6-3)** | VIT 13-6 (World Final 2024) |
| **Inferno** | **7** | 4 | **VIT leads (7-4)** | VIT 13-10 (IEM Chengdu 2025) |
| **Nuke** | **5** | 2 | **VIT dominant (5-2)** | VIT 13-7 (IEM Kraków, Feb 2026) |
| **Overpass** | 0 | 0 | No data | — |
| **Ancient** | 0 | 0 | No data | — |
| **Anubis** | 0 | 0 | No data | — |

**Most Recent H2H:** IEM Kraków 2026 (early Feb) — Vitality 2-0 MOUZ (Dust2 13-6, Nuke 13-7). VIT dominated convincingly just ~2 weeks ago.

**H2H Pattern:** Vitality wins this matchup consistently. On every map with data, VIT leads. The gap is largest on Dust2 (7-1) and Nuke (5-2). MOUZ's best H2H map is Inferno (4-7) — still losing but more competitive. Overpass is the only current map with no H2H data — it's the "mystery" battleground.

**H2H Override Assessment:** With 35 maps of H2H data and VIT winning 71.4%, this is a clear H2H override situation. Vitality simply knows how to beat MOUZ. However, per Principle #11, even deep H2H records can be broken — MOUZ just needs to find the right maps.

## 6. PGL Cluj-Napoca Tournament Form

### MOUZ (2-0)

| Round | Opponent | Score | Maps | Key Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| R1 | PARIVISION (#6) | **W 2-1** | Dust2 7-13 L, Inferno 13-7 W, Overpass 13-3 W | Lost own D2 but dominated OVP decider |
| R2 | NAVI (#8) | **W 2-0** | Inferno 13-9 W, Mirage 13-7 W | Clean sweep of a strong opponent |

**MOUZ PGL Cluj Pattern:**
- Inferno is their go-to (won 13-7 and 13-9)
- Overpass was dominant (13-3 vs PRV)
- Lost Dust2 7-13 — confirms it's a weakness
- Beat NAVI convincingly 2-0 — strong confidence booster
- Overall: 4 map wins, 1 loss at the event (80% map WR)

### Vitality (2-0)

| Round | Opponent | Score | Maps | Key Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|------|-----------|
| R1 | G2 (#10) | **W 2-1** | Mirage 13-11 W, Inferno 8-13 L, Anubis 13-8 W | Lost Inferno — rare weakness shown |
| R2 | MongolZ (#16) | **W 2-1** | Mirage 10-13 L, Dust2 13-4 W, Nuke 13-4 W | Lost Mirage — only weak map at event |

**Vitality PGL Cluj Pattern:**
- Lost Mirage once and Inferno once — only 2 map losses total
- When they win, they destroy: Dust2 13-4, Nuke 13-4, Anubis 13-8
- Mirage is their vulnerability — went 13-11 and 10-13 (the only maps opponents competed on)
- Dust2 and Nuke remain elite even at LAN
- Overall: 4 map wins, 2 losses (67% map WR at event — lower than their 82.5% 3-month average)

**Context:** Both teams are 2-0. **Winner advances to playoffs.** Loser drops to 2-1 (still alive, but needs one more win). This is a high-stakes advancement match, not elimination — less pressure than a 1-2 match.

## 7. Predicted Map Veto

```
1. BAN: MOUZ bans Dust2
   → Must remove VIT's 100% WR map (9-0 in 3 months). H2H is 7-1 VIT on Dust2.
   → MOUZ lost Dust2 7-13 at this event vs PRV. Absolute must-ban.

2. BAN: VIT bans Ancient
   → No H2H data on this map. Both teams have 1 map played (100% each, ⚠️).
   → VIT prefers to keep the match on well-scouted territory.
   → Could also ban Anubis — but VIT is 100% (3-0) on Anubis and might want it available.

3. PICK: MOUZ picks Inferno
   → 71.4% WR (5-2, 7 maps) — their strongest well-sampled map.
   → Won Inferno 13-7 and 13-9 at PGL Cluj.
   → H2H on Inferno: VIT leads 7-4, but MOUZ has won recent ones (22-19 OT Chengdu, 13-4 Austin).
   → This is MOUZ's best realistic chance to take a map.

4. PICK: VIT picks Nuke
   → 66.7% WR (4-2, 6 maps) with H2H dominance (5-2 vs MOUZ).
   → Just beat MOUZ 13-7 on Nuke at IEM Kraków 2 weeks ago.
   → Beat MongolZ 13-4 on Nuke at PGL Cluj.
   → VIT could also pick Overpass (100%) but Nuke has stronger H2H backing vs MOUZ.

5. BAN: MOUZ bans Anubis
   → 0 maps played — complete unknown. VIT is 100% (3-0) on Anubis.
   → Too risky to leave in when VIT has proven mastery.

6. BAN: VIT bans Mirage
   → VIT's weakest map at this event (13-11 and 10-13). 50% overall.
   → MOUZ beat NAVI 13-7 on Mirage at this event — showed competence.
   → VIT removes the one map where they've shown vulnerability.

7. DECIDER: Overpass
   → MOUZ 80% (4-1) | VIT 100% (6-0)
   → NO H2H DATA on Overpass — first time these teams would play it.
   → Both teams are excellent on this map. True unknown.
   → MOUZ beat PRV 13-3 at PGL Cluj. VIT beat FURIA 13-10, Aurora 13-7 at IEM Kraków.
```

**Alternative veto:** VIT picks Overpass (100%) instead of Nuke, and bans Nuke... unlikely since VIT's Nuke H2H vs MOUZ is 5-2. Or VIT bans Overpass to remove MOUZ's 80% map, picking Anubis instead — possible but VIT probably doesn't fear MOUZ's Overpass enough.

## 8. Map-by-Map Breakdown

### Map 1: Inferno (MOUZ Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- MOUZ: 71.4% WR (5-2, 7 maps) — won 13-7 vs PRV, 13-9 vs NAVI at PGL Cluj
- VIT: 75% WR (6-2, 8 maps) — lost 8-13 vs G2 at PGL Cluj

**H2H on Inferno: VIT 7-4 MOUZ**
- Recent: VIT 13-10 (Chengdu), MOUZ 22-19 OT (Chengdu), VIT 13-8 (London), MOUZ 13-4 (Austin Major)
- Pattern: VIT usually wins but MOUZ has had big performances too (13-4 and OT win)

**Key Players:**
- MOUZ: Spinx (1.14) for entries, torzsi AWP banana/pit
- VIT: ZywOo (1.40) dominant from any position, ropz (1.14) lurk A-site

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Inferno is CT-sided (~55% CT rounds). Banana control is crucial.
- VIT lost Inferno to G2 at PGL Cluj — their only Inferno loss at recent events. A crack in the armor.

**Predicted Score:** MOUZ wins **13-11**
**Confidence:** Low-Medium
**Key Factor:** This is MOUZ's best shot. They've been dominant on Inferno at PGL Cluj (13-7, 13-9) and VIT showed vulnerability (lost to G2). The H2H is 7-4 VIT but MOUZ's recent Inferno performances (13-4 Austin, 22-19 OT Chengdu) show they can compete. Brollan's slump (0.93) is a concern — if he shows up, MOUZ takes this. If not, VIT's depth carries.

---

### Map 2: Nuke (VIT Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- MOUZ: 33.3% WR (1-2, 3 maps ⚠️) — small sample but poor
- VIT: 66.7% WR (4-2, 6 maps) — won 13-4 vs MongolZ at PGL Cluj

**H2H on Nuke: VIT 5-2 MOUZ**
- Most recent: VIT 13-7 at IEM Kraków (2 weeks ago)
- VIT also won 16-13, 13-8, 13-7 on Nuke in H2H
- MOUZ's Nuke wins: 13-11 (IEM Rio 2024) and 13-5 (EPL S19) — both older

**Key Players:**
- VIT: ZywOo's AWP on upper/outside is devastating. Nuke's vertical gameplay suits VIT's coordination.
- MOUZ: torzsi needs to match ZywOo's AWP presence — extremely difficult on Nuke.

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Nuke is heavily CT-sided. VIT's disciplined CT-side and utility usage will be punishing.
- MOUZ starting T-side Nuke against VIT is a nightmare — they need 4+ T rounds to have a chance.

**Predicted Score:** Vitality wins **13-7**
**Confidence:** Medium-High
**Key Factor:** VIT just beat MOUZ 13-7 on Nuke 2 weeks ago. The H2H is 5-2 VIT. Nuke's CT-sided nature compounds VIT's tactical advantage. MOUZ's 33.3% Nuke WR (even on small sample) combined with the H2H makes this VIT's most reliable map. Expect a comfortable VIT win unless MOUZ's T-side finds a new approach they didn't have at Kraków.

---

### Map 3: Overpass (Decider)

**Historical Performance:**
- MOUZ: 80% WR (4-1, 5 maps) — won 13-3 vs PRV at PGL Cluj
- VIT: 100% WR (6-0, 6 maps) — won 13-10 vs FURIA, 13-7 vs Aurora, 13-5 vs BC.Game at IEM Kraków

**H2H on Overpass: No data** — first-ever meeting on this map

**Key Players:**
- MOUZ: Overpass is their best map by WR. Spinx and xertioN have been strong here.
- VIT: ZywOo's Overpass is historically elite. ropz's lurking through connector/monster is world-class.

**CT/T Side Analysis:**
- Overpass is CT-sided with complex utility usage and connector/monster control being key.
- Both teams have strong CT-side discipline. This map often comes down to mid-round adaptations.

**Predicted Score:** Vitality wins **13-11**
**Confidence:** Low
**Key Factor:** Both teams are elite on Overpass but VIT's 6-0 is more impressive than MOUZ's 4-1 (MOUZ's loss was on this map somewhere). No H2H data means this is truly unknown territory. VIT's overall superiority (better players, better win rate, better K/D) gives them the edge in a coin-flip scenario. ZywOo's AWP on Overpass's long angles is the difference-maker. But MOUZ's 80% shows genuine mastery — this could easily go the other way or to OT.

## 9. Player Matchups

### Star Player Comparison

| Player | Team | Rating | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|--------|------|-------|
| **ZywOo** | VIT | **1.40** | AWPer | Best player in the world, generational gap |
| **Spinx** | MOUZ | 1.14 | Rifler | MOUZ's carry, needs to be at his best |
| **flameZ** | VIT | 1.14 | Rifler | Aggressive entry, high K/D |
| **ropz** | VIT | 1.14 | Rifler | Methodical lurker, clutch king |
| **mezii** | VIT | 1.11 | Rifler | Versatile, underrated consistency |
| **xertioN** | MOUZ | 1.08 | Rifler | Young talent |
| **torzsi** | MOUZ | 1.04 | AWPer | Solid but outmatched by ZywOo |
| **Jimpphat** | MOUZ | 1.02 | Rifler | Young Finnish talent |
| **apEX** | VIT | 0.96 | IGL | Best-fragging IGL in Tier 1 |
| **Brollan** | MOUZ | 0.93 | Rifler | **Deep slump — massive liability** |

### AWP Matchup: torzsi vs ZywOo

- **torzsi** (1.04) — Hybrid AWPer, can rifle effectively too. Solid but not spectacular.
- **ZywOo** (1.40) — The greatest AWPer currently playing. His rating gap over every other player is enormous. Multiple HLTV #1 player awards.
- **Edge: ZywOo (massive)** — This isn't close. ZywOo at 1.40 is playing at a level that makes every AWP duel lopsided. torzsi needs to avoid straight duels and play off-angles.

### IGL Comparison

- **MOUZ** — No traditional IGL listed. sycrone (coach) handles strategy. Team plays a loose, aggressive style relying on individual skill.
- **apEX** (0.96) — Aggressive IGL who fraggs far above the typical IGL level. Combined with XTQZZZ as coach, VIT's tactical preparation is world-class.
- **Tactical Edge: Vitality** — apEX + XTQZZZ is the best IGL/coach duo in CS2. Their ability to prepare for specific opponents (as seen in the consistent H2H dominance) is a massive advantage.

### X-Factor: Brollan's Slump

Brollan at 0.93 rating over 3 months is the biggest concern for MOUZ. He was once a 1.15+ caliber player. If Brollan plays at even 1.05, MOUZ's firepower becomes competitive. At 0.93, they're essentially playing 4v5 in terms of impact.

---

## 10. Red Flags & X-Factors

```
RED FLAGS:
├── MOUZ
│   ├── Brollan at 0.93 — massive slump, MOUZ playing with a handicap
│   ├── H2H is 10-25 on current maps — VIT owns this matchup historically
│   ├── Just lost to VIT 0-2 at IEM Kraków (D2 6-13, Nuke 7-13) — 2 weeks ago
│   ├── Nuke is 33.3% — nearly unplayable if VIT picks it
│   ├── Dust2 must-ban reduces their veto flexibility
│   └── Lost IEM Kraków to Spirit 0-2 after VIT loss — confidence may be fragile
├── Vitality
│   ├── Lost Mirage twice at PGL Cluj (13-11 W and 10-13 L) — a vulnerability
│   ├── Lost Inferno 8-13 to G2 at PGL Cluj — not invincible
│   ├── Both PGL Cluj wins were 2-1 — haven't swept anyone yet at this event
│   └── "2-0 pressure" — advancing match, but not elimination (lower stakes)

X-FACTORS:
├── ZywOo's form — At 1.40, he's in god mode. If this continues, VIT wins any map.
├── Overpass as the unknown — No H2H data. Both teams are elite (80% / 100%).
│   This is the one map where historical patterns can't predict the outcome.
├── Brollan revival — If Brollan shows any sign of his peak form, MOUZ's
│   ceiling rises dramatically. He was a 1.15+ player not long ago.
├── VIT's PGL Cluj form — 2-0 but dropped 2 maps. Are they slightly below peak?
│   Their IEM Kraków form was more dominant.
└── MOUZ's momentum — Beat NAVI 2-0 convincingly. Coming in with confidence.
    But they also had momentum at IEM Kraków before VIT crushed them 2-0.
```

## 11. Series Prediction: MOUZ vs Vitality (BO3)

**Predicted Maps:**
- Map 1: Inferno (MOUZ pick) → **MOUZ wins 13-11**
- Map 2: Nuke (VIT pick) → **Vitality wins 13-7**
- Map 3: Overpass (Decider) → **Vitality wins 13-11**

**Series Result: Vitality wins 2-1**
**Confidence: Medium**

**Most Likely Scenarios:**

| Probability | Outcome | Reasoning |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **35%** | **VIT 2-0** | VIT sweeps — takes Inferno on MOUZ's pick (they're 75% on it) and dominates Nuke. MOUZ never reaches Overpass. |
| **25%** | **VIT 2-1** | MOUZ takes Inferno (their best map at PGL Cluj), VIT wins Nuke easily, Overpass decider goes to VIT. ZywOo carries on the decider. |
| 20% | MOUZ 2-1 | MOUZ wins Inferno + Overpass. Brollan has a revival game. VIT's slight PGL Cluj form dip continues. |
| 10% | VIT 2-1 (alt maps) | Different veto leads to different maps. VIT still wins via depth. |
| 10% | MOUZ 2-0 | MOUZ peaks, Brollan revives, VIT has an uncharacteristic off day. Highly unlikely. |

**VIT total: 70% | MOUZ total: 30%**

**Key Series Swing Points:**
1. **Map 1 Inferno** — If MOUZ takes it, the series opens up and they have a real shot at Overpass. If VIT steals MOUZ's pick (like they stole Nuke at Kraków), MOUZ is mentally broken.
2. **Overpass decider** — No H2H data. The first team to establish CT-side control wins. ZywOo's AWP on Overpass's long angles vs MOUZ's aggressive approach.
3. **Brollan's performance** — If he's at 1.00+, MOUZ can compete. At 0.93, they don't have enough firepower.
4. **ZywOo having an off day** — The only realistic path for MOUZ in a sweep scenario. At 1.40, ZywOo is the difference between a close match and a blowout.

## 12. Prediction vs Market

| Outcome | My Probability | Polymarket | Edge | Signal |
|---------|---------------|------------|------|--------|
| MOUZ ML | 30% | 31.5% | -1.5% | No Value (fairly priced) |
| VIT ML | 70% | 68.5% | +1.5% | No Value (fairly priced) |
| Map 1: MOUZ | 52% | 36.0% | **+16.0%** | **STRONG VALUE** (MOUZ's Inferno pick) |
| Map 1: VIT | 48% | 64.0% | -16.0% | Fade |
| Map 2: MOUZ | 20% | 40.0% | -20.0% | **Fade** (VIT's Nuke pick + H2H 5-2) |
| Map 2: VIT | 80% | 60.0% | **+20.0%** | **STRONG VALUE** (VIT Nuke dominance) |
| Over 2.5 maps | 50% | 46.0% | +4.0% | Slight lean Over but below threshold |
| Under 2.5 maps | 50% | 54.0% | -4.0% | Slight lean Over but below threshold |
| VIT -1.5 | 35% | 38.5% | -3.5% | No Value |
| MOUZ +1.5 | 65% | 61.5% | +3.5% | No Value |

**Value Plays:**

1. **Map 1 MOUZ Winner (36% → should be ~52%)** — If Map 1 is Inferno (MOUZ's pick as predicted), the market is significantly underpricing MOUZ. MOUZ is 71.4% on Inferno and won it twice at PGL Cluj (13-7, 13-9). VIT lost Inferno 8-13 vs G2 at this very event. The market at 64% VIT doesn't account for MOUZ's pick advantage. $2.8K volume — thin but tradeable.

2. **Map 2 VIT Winner (60% → should be ~80%)** — If Map 2 is Nuke (VIT's pick), VIT should be a massive favorite. H2H is 5-2 VIT on Nuke, they just beat MOUZ 13-7 two weeks ago, and MOUZ is 33.3% on Nuke. The market at 60% VIT dramatically underprices this. Only $104 volume though — essentially untraded.

3. **ML is fairly priced** — My 70% VIT vs market's 68.5% is only a 1.5% edge, well below actionable. The $400K volume confirms efficient pricing.

4. **O/U 2.5 is close to a coin flip** — I have 50/50, market has 54% Under. Not enough edge either way. The Under case (VIT sweep) at 35% is real but MOUZ's Inferno strength makes a 3-map series plausible.

**Market Efficiency Notes:**
- The ML market ($400K) is very efficient — no edge to be found
- Map-level markets show the same pattern as previous analyses: they don't properly account for which specific maps will be played (Map 1 at 64% VIT when it's likely MOUZ's Inferno pick is a clear mispricing)
- The O/U market ($241K volume) is surprisingly well-traded — both sides of 50/50 are reasonable given VIT's dominance vs MOUZ's Inferno strength
