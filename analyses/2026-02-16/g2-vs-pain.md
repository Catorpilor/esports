**Market Insights:**
- G2 is a heavy favorite at 78.5% — bookmakers even heavier at ~80% (avg 1.24 odds)
- Map 1 odds (66.5% G2) are notably lower than ML (78.5%) — market expects paiN has a real shot on their own pick
- Under 2.5 maps favored at 61% — market leans toward a G2 2-0, but it's not dominant
- Map handicap is essentially a coin flip (49/51) — significant uncertainty about 2-0 vs 2-1
- **Very low volume on map-level markets ($45-67)** — these prices may be stale/unreliable
- **High volume on ML ($90K) and handicap ($87K)** — these are the liquid, reliable markets

**HLTV Odds Comparison:**
- HLTV bookmakers: G2 ~1.24 / paiN ~3.85 → G2 ~80.6% / paiN ~26% (before vig)
- Polymarket: G2 78.5% / paiN 21.5%
- Slight alignment — Polymarket is marginally more generous to paiN

### PGL Cluj Veto Patterns

**G2 at PGL Cluj:**
- vs Vitality (R1): Banned Nuke, Overpass. Picked Mirage. Lost 1-2.
- vs PARIVISION (R2): Banned Overpass, Anubis. Picked Inferno. Lost 1-2.
- **Pattern:** Always bans Overpass. Banned Nuke vs Vitality but not vs PRV (PRV banned it instead). Picks Mirage or Inferno.

**paiN at PGL Cluj:**
- vs MongolZ (R1): Banned Ancient, Inferno. Picked Nuke (won 13-7). Lost 1-2 (Mirage 1-13, Dust2 2-13).
- vs Aurora (R2): Banned Overpass, Inferno. Picked Nuke (won 13-10). Lost 1-2 (Anubis 7-13, Dust2 4-13).
- **Pattern:** Always picks Nuke (won both times). Bans Overpass + one of Ancient/Inferno. Gets destroyed on Dust2 decider (2-13, 4-13).

---

## 4. Predicted Map Veto

**Key Dynamics:**
- G2 has been banning Nuke (vs VIT) but may not need to here — however, paiN is 80% on Nuke and won both PGL picks on it. G2 should respect this.
- paiN always bans Overpass (0-2) and always picks Nuke.
- G2 wants Mirage or Ancient.
- The big question: does Dust2 end up in the pool? paiN is 14.3% on Dust2 but it keeps appearing as their decider and they keep getting crushed.

```
PREDICTED VETO:
1. BAN: G2 bans Nuke — paiN's 80% signature map, must remove
2. BAN: paiN bans Ancient — G2's 75% map, paiN 0% (0-1)
3. PICK: G2 picks Mirage — 66.7% WR, best remaining map, H2H 0-0 on Mirage
4. PICK: paiN picks Inferno — G2's worst map (20%), paiN banned it at PGL but may target it here
   ALT: paiN picks Anubis or Dust2 — all risky options for paiN
5. BAN: G2 bans Overpass — consistent permaban at PGL
6. BAN: paiN bans Anubis — avoid G2's remaining decent map
7. DECIDER: Dust2 — G2 44.4% vs paiN 14.3%
```

**Alternative Veto (paiN targets Inferno):**
If paiN picks Inferno (G2's 20% map), G2 would be on their weakest map. But paiN has 0 Inferno maps in 3 months — complete unknown. More likely paiN sticks to what they know and picks something else.

**Most likely maps:** Mirage (G2 pick), Inferno/Dust2 (paiN pick or decider), Dust2/Anubis (decider)

## 5. Map-by-Map Breakdown

### Map 1: Mirage (G2 Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- G2: 66.7% win rate (4-2, last 3 months)
- paiN: 40.0% win rate (2-3, last 3 months)
- At PGL Cluj: G2 picked Mirage vs VIT, won 13-11 (their only R1 map win). paiN was destroyed 1-13 on Mirage vs MongolZ.

**H2H on Mirage:** No direct H2H on this specific map.

**Key Factor:** G2 has shown they can win Mirage at this event (13-11 vs #1 Vitality). paiN was obliterated 1-13 on Mirage just days ago. G2 should be comfortable here.

**Predicted Score:** G2 wins 13-7
**Confidence:** Medium-High

### Map 2: Inferno (paiN Pick) / Dust2 (Decider Path)

**Scenario A — paiN picks Inferno (targeting G2's 20% map):**
- G2: 20.0% (1-4) — terrible, their worst map
- paiN: No data (0 maps in 3 months) — complete unknown
- H2H: G2 beat paiN 13-8 on Inferno at ESL Pro League S21

**Scenario B — Dust2 ends up as Map 2 or decider:**
- G2: 44.4% (4-5)
- paiN: 14.3% (1-6) — catastrophic
- H2H: G2 beat paiN 13-7 on Dust2 (StarLadder Budapest) and 13-6 (BLAST Austin) — G2 2-0 H2H on Dust2

**Key insight:** paiN is in a bind. Every remaining map is bad for them. Their best strategic play is Inferno (exploiting G2's 20% WR) but they have zero recent data there. Dust2 is their graveyard (14.3%, 0-2 H2H vs G2, and 2-13 + 4-13 at this event).

**If Inferno:** paiN 55% / G2 45% — G2's worst map but H2H favors G2
**If Dust2:** G2 70% / paiN 30% — H2H dominance (2-0) and paiN's PGL Dust2 record is 2-13, 4-13

**Predicted Score (Inferno):** paiN 13-10 (targeting G2 weakness)
**Predicted Score (Dust2):** G2 13-6 (H2H + paiN's Dust2 collapse)
**Confidence:** Low (high uncertainty on which maps appear)

### Map 3 (Decider — if needed): Dust2 or Anubis

If Dust2 is the decider (most likely):
- G2 44.4% vs paiN 14.3%, plus 2-0 H2H
- paiN has been destroyed on Dust2 at this event twice
- **G2 wins 13-7**

If Anubis is the decider:
- G2 33.3% (1-2) vs paiN 0% (0-1) — both bad, but G2 less bad
- G2 lost Anubis 8-13 vs VIT at this event
- **G2 wins 13-9** (slight edge by default)

## 8. Head-to-Head History

| Date | Event | Winner | Score | Map | Result |
|------|-------|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| ~Feb 2026 | StarLadder Budapest Major 2025 | G2 | — | Dust2 | 13-7 |
| ~Jun 2025 | BLAST.tv Austin Major 2025 | G2 | — | Dust2 | 13-6 |
| ~Mar 2025 | ESL Pro League S21 | G2 | 2-0 | Inferno | 13-8 |
| ~Mar 2025 | ESL Pro League S21 | G2 | — | Nuke | 13-5 |

**H2H Pattern:** G2 dominates completely — **4-0 in matches, 6-0 in maps**. All maps were decisive wins (13-5, 13-6, 13-7, 13-8). Notably, G2 even won Nuke 13-5 despite Nuke being paiN's best map.

**Critical H2H Insight:** G2 beat paiN 13-5 on Nuke — paiN's 80% map. This is a massive psychological factor. Even on paiN's best map, G2 has dominated them. With Nuke banned in this match, paiN has no refuge.

## 9. Tournament Context

- **Event:** PGL Cluj-Napoca 2026 (S-Tier)
- **Stage:** Swiss Round 3 — 0-2 Pool
- **Format:** BO3
- **Stakes:** **ELIMINATION MATCH** — Loser is eliminated from the tournament
- **Prize implications:** Staying alive vs going home
- **Bracket Position:** Both teams need to win 3 straight BO3s to advance (0-2 → 3-2)
- **Crowd Factor:** LAN in Romania — neutral crowd for both

**Elimination Context:** Both teams are desperate. G2 lost to stronger opponents (#1 VIT, #6 PRV) — they should view this as a winnable match. paiN has been outclassed outside Nuke and faces a team that historically dominates them.

## 11. Series Prediction

**Predicted Maps:**
- Map 1: Mirage (G2 pick) → **G2 wins 13-7**
- Map 2: Inferno or Dust2 (paiN pick or decider) → **G2 wins 13-9** (Inferno) or **G2 wins 13-6** (Dust2)
- Map 3: Dust2 (Decider, if needed) → **G2 wins 13-7**

**Series Result: G2 wins 2-0**
**Confidence: Medium-High**

**Most Likely Scenarios:**
1. **45%** — G2 2-0 (G2 comfortable on their pick, paiN collapses on their weak maps)
2. **25%** — G2 2-1 (paiN steals a map by exploiting G2's Inferno weakness or through elimination pressure)
3. **20%** — paiN 2-1 (paiN finds Inferno magic + decider upset — low probability but elimination games produce miracles)
4. **10%** — paiN 2-0 (extremely unlikely given H2H and map pool disparity)

**G2 win probability: 70%**
**paiN win probability: 30%**

**Key Factors:**
- G2's 4-0 H2H (6-0 maps) is the strongest predictor — even on paiN's Nuke, G2 won 13-5
- With Nuke banned, paiN has no strong map to lean on
- paiN's PGL record outside Nuke (0-4 maps, avg 3.5 rounds) is alarming
- However, elimination pressure (Principle #12) gives paiN a floor — they won't go quietly
- G2 also needs this win — they haven't been great either (0-2 at PGL)

## 12. Prediction vs Market

| Outcome | My Probability | Polymarket | Edge | Signal |
|---------|---------------|------------|------|--------|
| G2 ML | 70% | 78.5% | -8.5% | **paiN Value** |
| paiN ML | 30% | 21.5% | +8.5% | **paiN Value** |
| Map 1: G2 | 70% | 66.5% | +3.5% | No Value |
| Map 1: paiN | 30% | 33.5% | -3.5% | No Value |
| Map 2: G2 | 60% | 74.5% | -14.5% | **paiN Value** |
| Map 2: paiN | 40% | 25.5% | +14.5% | **paiN Value** |
| Over 2.5 maps | 45% | 39.0% | +6.0% | Slight Value |
| Under 2.5 maps | 55% | 61.0% | -6.0% | No Value |
| G2 -1.5 | 45% | 49.0% | -4.0% | No Value |
| paiN +1.5 | 55% | 51.0% | +4.0% | No Value |

**Value Plays:**
- **paiN ML at 21.5% (~4.65 odds)** — My model has them at 30%. In an elimination match with both teams at 0-2, 21.5% undervalues paiN. Elimination pressure (Principle #12) elevates underdog performance. Edge: +8.5%.
- **Map 2 paiN at 25.5% (~3.92 odds)** — If paiN targets G2's Inferno (20% WR), they have a real shot. Market at 25.5% vs my 40% is a 14.5% edge. BUT low volume ($45) — thin market.
- **Over 2.5 maps at 39% (~2.56 odds)** — Slight value at +6%. If paiN picks Inferno and wins it, we go to 3 maps easily. Market may be underweighting the Inferno angle.

**Market Efficiency Notes:**
- ML market is liquid ($90K volume) and fairly efficient — G2 is rightfully favored but 78.5% may be too high
- Map-level markets have almost zero volume ($45-67) — prices are unreliable and possibly stale
- Handicap market ($87K) at ~50/50 suggests smart money is uncertain about 2-0 vs 2-1
- **Applying Principle #20 (Market Respect):** My 70% for G2 vs market's 78.5% — only 8.5% gap, within acceptable range. Not a screaming disagreement, but enough to warrant a small paiN ML position at 4.65 odds.

**Bottom Line:** G2 should win this, but paiN at 21.5% (4.65 odds) in an elimination match has value. The handicap market at ~50/50 is the smartest read — G2 wins but it may go 3 maps.

## 13. BACKTEST — Actual Result

### Final Result: G2 2-0 paiN ✅ (Winner AND scoreline correct!)

**Actual Veto:**
1. paiN ban Ancient ✅ (predicted correctly)
2. G2 ban Nuke ✅ (predicted correctly)
3. paiN pick Inferno ✅ (predicted correctly — paiN targeted G2's 20% map)
4. G2 pick Mirage ✅ (predicted correctly)
5. G2 ban Overpass ✅ (predicted correctly)
6. paiN ban Dust2 ❌ (predicted Anubis — paiN banned their graveyard Dust2 instead)
7. Decider: Anubis ❌ (predicted Dust2)

**Veto Score: 5/7** — Best veto prediction to date! Only missed the final ban/decider swap.

### Actual Maps vs Prediction

| Map | Predicted | Actual | Score | Halves (G2 perspective) | Correct? |
|-----|-----------|--------|-------|-------------------------|----------|
| Map 1 | Mirage (G2 pick) → G2 13-7 | Inferno (paiN pick) → G2 13-10 | 13-10 | G2 CT 8-4, T 5-6 | ✅ Winner (predicted G2 wins Inferno 13-9) |
| Map 2 | Inferno/Dust2 → G2 wins | Mirage (G2 pick) → G2 13-9 | 13-9 | G2 CT 8-4, T 5-5 | ✅ Winner + close to predicted score (13-7) |
| Map 3 | Dust2 (decider) → G2 13-7 | Not played (2-0) | — | — | N/A |

**POTM: HeavyGod (G2)** — 1.06 rated player stepped up in the elimination match.

### Key Observations

**1. paiN picked Inferno — exactly as we theorized:**
Our analysis noted: "paiN's best strategic play is Inferno (exploiting G2's 20% WR)." paiN did exactly this. But G2 won 13-10 anyway — their 20% Inferno WR was misleading in this specific matchup. G2 had beat paiN 13-8 on Inferno in H2H (ESL Pro League S21), confirming **Principle #1 (H2H > Map Stats)**.

**2. paiN banned Dust2 instead of Anubis:**
Smart move by paiN — they were 14.3% on Dust2 and had been destroyed 2-13 and 4-13 on it at PGL Cluj. Banning their absolute worst map rather than a map with no data (Anubis 0-1) was rational. This shifted the decider to Anubis, but G2 never needed it.

**3. G2's CT side was dominant on both maps:**
- Inferno: G2 CT 8-4 (strong banana control)
- Mirage: G2 CT 8-4 (identical CT half)

G2 consistently won 8 CT rounds on both maps, building comfortable leads before switching sides. This contrasts with MOUZ's CT-side collapse vs VIT — G2 had no such weakness.

**4. paiN competed but couldn't close:**
Inferno 13-10 and Mirage 13-9 are respectable scores — paiN didn't collapse like they did vs MongolZ (1-13, 2-13) or Aurora (4-13). Elimination pressure (Principle #12) did elevate their performance, but G2's H2H dominance (now 6-0 → 8-0 maps) was too much.

### Series Prediction Assessment

| Prediction | Actual | Correct? |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Winner: G2** | **G2** | ✅ |
| **Scoreline: 2-0** | **2-0** | ✅ |
| G2 probability: 70% | G2 won | ✅ |
| G2 2-0 probability: 45% | G2 2-0 | ✅ (most likely scenario hit) |
| paiN picks Inferno | paiN picked Inferno | ✅ |
| G2 picks Mirage | G2 picked Mirage | ✅ |

### Market Call Assessment

| Market | Our Call | Polymarket | Actual | Correct? |
|--------|---------|------------|--------|----------|
| **G2 ML (78.5%)** | paiN Value at 30% | 78.5% G2 | ✅ G2 won 2-0 | ❌ Wrong — market was right, G2 was correctly priced (or underpriced!) |
| **Map 2 paiN (25.5%)** | paiN Value at 40% | 25.5% paiN | ❌ G2 won 13-9 | ❌ Wrong — G2 dominated their Mirage pick |
| **Over 2.5 (39%)** | Slight Value at 45% | 39% Over | ❌ Under hit (2-0) | ❌ Wrong — G2 swept |
| **Under 2.5 (61%)** | No Value | 61% Under | ✅ Under hit | ✅ Correct — no position recommended |

**Market Calls: 1/3** (only the "no position on Under" was correct by not taking a bad bet)

### Lessons Learned

**1. H2H dominance is the strongest predictor — even overrides map weakness:**
G2 had 20% Inferno WR overall, but the H2H on Inferno was G2 13-8 paiN. G2 won Inferno 13-10 here. When H2H is 6-0 maps and dominant on every surface, the "weaker" team has a psychological ceiling they can't break through. Principle #1 held perfectly.

**2. The market was right — our "paiN value" call was wrong:**
We called paiN ML at 21.5% as value (model said 30%). G2 won 2-0 convincingly. The market at 78.5% G2 was actually closer to reality than our 70%. When H2H is THIS lopsided (6-0 → 8-0 maps), the model should weight H2H even more heavily and reduce the underdog's probability. Principle #20 (Market Respect) applies: our 8.5% disagreement with the market was in the wrong direction.

**3. Elimination pressure has limits against H2H dominance:**
paiN played better than their PGL form (10 and 9 rounds vs prior collapses of 1, 2, 4 rounds). Elimination pressure DID elevate them (Principle #12). But it wasn't enough to overcome a team that has beaten them 8-0 in maps. Principle #12's boost has a ceiling when facing a historically dominant opponent.

**4. Sweep probability was correct this time (45%):**
After learning from the MOUZ-VIT backtest (Principle #24), we assigned 45% to G2 2-0 — and it hit. The adjusted sweep probability worked well here. Continue using 40-45% for sweep when favorite has strong H2H + opponent's pick is exploitable.
