## 4. Predicted Map Veto

Both teams want to ban Anubis (FaZe 0-1, Astralis permaban). The question is who burns the first ban on it.

**PREDICTED VETO (Primary Scenario):**

1. **BAN: FaZe bans Inferno** — FaZe's 0% map (0-4). Cannot afford to play this under any circumstance. More critical than banning Anubis since Astralis would ban Anubis anyway.

2. **BAN: Astralis bans Anubis** — Permaban. Astralis has never played it this window. With FaZe already banning Inferno, Astralis locks in their standard ban.

3. **PICK: FaZe picks Mirage** — FaZe's 67% vs Astralis's 20% (1-4). Massive structural advantage. Astralis has been demolished on Mirage (5-13 vs NAVI, 4-13 vs FUT, 7-13 vs FUT at IEM). This is the most exploitable mismatch.

4. **PICK: Astralis picks Overpass** — Astralis's signature map (75%, 6-2). First pick in almost every match. Includes 13-2 stomp of 3DMAX at PGL. Even though FaZe is 67% on Overpass, Astralis has far more reps and it's their identity.

5. **BAN: FaZe bans Nuke** — FaZe's worst remaining map (33%, 1-2). Lost 2-13 to 3DMAX and 6-13 to BC.Game on Nuke at IEM.

6. **BAN: Astralis bans Dust2** — Avoids H2H trauma (lost 4-13 to FaZe at ESL Pro League S22). FaZe is also 67% on Dust2. Too risky to leave open.

7. **DECIDER: Ancient** — FaZe 40% (2-3) vs Astralis 100% (2-0, small sample). H2H: FaZe won 13-7 at ESL Pro League S22.

**Alternative Scenario (if FaZe bans Anubis first):**
1. FaZe ban Anubis → 2. Astralis ban Mirage → 3. FaZe pick Dust2 → 4. Astralis pick Overpass → 5. FaZe ban Inferno → 6. Astralis ban Nuke → 7. Decider: Ancient

Both scenarios converge on: **Map 1 = FaZe's pick (Mirage or Dust2), Map 2 = Overpass (Astralis pick), Decider = Ancient.**

## 5. Map-by-Map Breakdown

### Map 1: Mirage (FaZe Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- FaZe: 67% (2-1) — 13-2 stomp of PARIVISION, 5-13 loss to MOUZ at IEM
- Astralis: 20% (1-4) — 5-13 vs NAVI, 4-13 vs FUT (PGL), 12-16 vs fnatic, 7-13 vs FUT (IEM). Sole win: 13-11 vs FURIA.

**Key Dynamics:**
- Astralis has been consistently destroyed on Mirage at PGL. The 5-13 and 4-13 scorelines show systemic weakness, not bad luck.
- FaZe's 13-2 vs PARIVISION shows they can dominate on Mirage when on form. The 5-13 loss to MOUZ was against a top-4 team.
- Elimination pressure per Principle #12: Astralis will play above baseline but has a ceiling on a map where they're structurally weak.

**Predicted Score:** FaZe wins **13-8**
**Confidence:** High
**Key Factor:** Astralis's 20% WR on Mirage is a systemic vulnerability. FaZe should dominate T-side against Astralis's weak CT setups on this map.

### Map 2: Overpass (Astralis Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- Astralis: 75% (6-2) — Signature map. 13-2 vs 3DMAX, 13-11 vs PARIVISION, 13-7 vs paiN, 13-8 vs FURIA. Losses: 8-13 vs Spirit, 7-13 vs FUT.
- FaZe: 67% (2-1) — Won 13-5 vs Heroic at PGL R1. Lost to Vitality 2-13 at Budapest Major (outlier).

**Key Dynamics:**
- Overpass is Astralis's identity map — they pick it first in almost every match and have 6 wins on it.
- FaZe's 13-5 Overpass win at PGL was impressive but Heroic is not Astralis-caliber on this map.
- Astralis lost Overpass 7-13 to FUT in R3 — but per Principle #22, one loss doesn't erase a 75% track record.
- FaZe does have Overpass experience and it's one of their better maps (67%), making this closer than the typical "pick map" advantage.

**Predicted Score:** Astralis wins **13-10**
**Confidence:** Medium
**Key Factor:** Astralis's 6-2 record and deep familiarity with Overpass setups should prevail, but FaZe's talent means they'll keep it competitive. The 7-13 loss to FUT adds some uncertainty.

### Map 3: Ancient (Decider)

**Historical Performance:**
- FaZe: 40% (2-3) — Won 13-9 vs Heroic, 13-3 vs BC.Game. Lost 4-13 vs Falcons, 11-13 vs PARIVISION, and one more at Budapest.
- Astralis: 100% (2-0) — Won 13-7 vs PARIVISION, 13-4 vs fnatic. ⚠️ Only 2 maps — small sample.

**H2H on Ancient:** FaZe beat Astralis **13-7** at ESL Pro League S22.

**Key Dynamics:**
- Per Principle #1 (H2H > Map Stats): FaZe won the H2H convincingly (13-7). But it's only 1 map — not deep enough to override raw stats with high confidence.
- Astralis's 2-0 is impressive but against PARIVISION and fnatic — neither is FaZe's caliber.
- FaZe's Ancient results are wildly inconsistent: 13-3 and 13-9 wins mixed with 4-13 and 11-13 losses. This map is a coinflip for FaZe depending on the day.
- Elimination pressure (Principle #12): Both teams are fighting for survival. Pressure effects cancel out.

**Predicted Score:** FaZe wins **13-11**
**Confidence:** Low
**Key Factor:** Genuine coinflip. H2H gives FaZe a slight edge but the sample is thin. FaZe's individual talent (frozen, Twistzz) could be decisive in clutch rounds on a close decider.

## 6. Player Matchups

### Star Player Comparison

| Player | Team | Rating (3mo) | Role | Key Stat |
|--------|------|-------------|------|----------|
| frozen | FaZe | 1.17 | Star rifler | FaZe's best performer; 17K + 1.64 impact vs Heroic |
| Twistzz | FaZe | 1.12 | Rifler/lurk | Consistent veteran; Major winner |
| broky | FaZe | 1.00 | AWPer | Below-average form; Antwerp Major winner |
| karrigan | FaZe | ~0.90 | IGL | Legendary game-reader; experience edge |
| jcobbb | FaZe | ~1.00 | Support | Newer addition; had key 3K at PGL |
| Staehr | Astralis | 1.12 | Star rifler | Astralis's best player; young talent |
| jabbi | Astralis | 1.03 | Rifler | Experienced; formerly the star, now slightly below |
| HooXi | Astralis | ~0.85 | IGL | Fragging liability; tactical caller |
| phzy | Astralis | ~1.00 | Rifler | Newer player |
| ryu | Astralis | ~1.00 | AWPer | Newer addition to roster |

**AWP Matchup:**
- FaZe AWPer: broky — 1.00 rating, in a slump. Major winner but not performing at his peak.
- Astralis AWPer: ryu — Relatively new to the top level. Limited data.
- **Edge:** Slight FaZe — broky has higher ceiling even in poor form.

**IGL Comparison:**
- FaZe IGL: karrigan — One of the most experienced IGLs in CS history. Adaptive style, known for mid-round reads. Has led FaZe to Major victory and 3 Major finals.
- Astralis IGL: HooXi — Experienced but fragging is a consistent weakness. Tactical focus.
- **Edge:** FaZe — karrigan's experience in elimination matches is unparalleled.

**Individual Talent Gap:** FaZe has a clear edge with frozen (1.17) + Twistzz (1.12) vs Staehr (1.12) alone carrying Astralis. FaZe has two players at 1.12+ while Astralis has one. This matters most on the decider map where individual skill becomes decisive.

## 7. Recent Form

### FaZe Recent Results

| Date | Opponent | Score | Event | Key Maps |
|------|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Feb 16 | PARIVISION | **1-2 L** | PGL Cluj R3 | Mirage 13-2 W, Ancient 11-13 L, Inferno 9-13 L |
| Feb 15 | Falcons | **1-2 L** | PGL Cluj R2 | Anubis 9-13 L, Dust2 13-11 W, Ancient 4-13 L |
| Feb 14 | Heroic | **2-0 W** | PGL Cluj R1 | Overpass 13-5 W, Ancient 13-9 W |
| Feb 3 | MOUZ | **0-2 L** | IEM Krakow | Mirage 5-13 L, Inferno 6-13 L |
| Jan 31 | 3DMAX | **0-2 L** | IEM Krakow | Inferno 7-13 L, Nuke 2-13 L |
| Dec 14 | Vitality | **1-3 L** | Budapest Major GF | Nuke 13-6 W, Dust2 3-13 L, Inferno 9-13 L, Overpass 2-13 L |

**Form Assessment:** FaZe is **Cold** — 1 win in last 6 series. They've been hemorrhaging maps across all events. Inferno is a black hole (0-4). Ancient is inconsistent. Only Mirage and Dust2 remain somewhat reliable. The R1 win over Heroic is their only bright spot.

### Astralis Recent Results

| Date | Opponent | Score | Event | Key Maps |
|------|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Feb 16 | FUT | **0-2 L** | PGL Cluj R3 | Overpass 7-13 L, Mirage 4-13 L |
| Feb 15 | 3DMAX | **2-0 W** | PGL Cluj R2 | Overpass 13-2 W, Nuke 13-11 W |
| Feb 14 | NAVI | **0-2 L** | PGL Cluj R1 | Nuke 7-13 L, Mirage 5-13 L |
| Feb 7 | FURIA | **1-2 L** | IEM Krakow | Overpass 13-8 W, Nuke 9-13 L, Mirage 13-11 W* |
| Jan ~30 | FUT | **~1-2 L** | IEM Krakow | Overpass 13-11 W*, Nuke 13-2 W*, Mirage 7-13 L |
| Jan ~28 | fnatic | **2-1 W** | BLAST Bounty | Overpass ~W, Mirage ~L, Ancient 13-4 W |

*Some IEM results are approximate from aggregated data.

**Form Assessment:** Astralis is **Cold** — only beating lower-tier teams (3DMAX, fnatic). Got demolished by NAVI (0-2) and FUT (0-2) at PGL. Their reliance on Overpass is a double-edged sword — when opponents neutralize it (FUT 13-7), Astralis has no backup plan.

## 8. Head-to-Head History

| Date | Event | Winner | Score | Maps |
|------|-------|--------|-------|------|
| Feb 2026 | ESL Pro League S22 | **FaZe** | **2-0** | Dust2 13-4, Ancient 13-7 |

**H2H Pattern:** Extremely limited — only one recent meeting. FaZe won convincingly (2-0), winning both maps by comfortable margins. However, per Principle #10, one series is not deep enough to establish a dominant pattern. The Dust2 13-4 scoreline suggests Astralis may specifically avoid Dust2 in the veto (supporting our veto prediction where Astralis bans Dust2).

---

## 9. Tournament Context

- **Event:** PGL Cluj-Napoca 2026 (Major)
- **Stage:** Swiss Stage, Round 4 (1-2 bracket)
- **Format:** BO3
- **Stakes:** **ELIMINATION MATCH** — Loser is eliminated from the Major. Winner advances to 2-2 and plays one more round for Legends stage.
- **FaZe's Path:** Beat Heroic R1 (2-0), lost to Falcons R2 (1-2), lost to PARIVISION R3 (1-2). On a 2-series losing streak.
- **Astralis's Path:** Lost to NAVI R1 (0-2), beat 3DMAX R2 (2-0), lost to FUT R3 (0-2). Only beat the weakest opponent they've faced.
- **Crowd Factor:** LAN in Romania. Neutral crowd for both teams. No home advantage for either side.
- **Pressure Factor:** Per Principle #12, elimination pressure elevates performance. Both teams should play above their recent baseline. karrigan's experience in elimination scenarios is a significant intangible for FaZe.

## 10. Red Flags & X-Factors

```
RED FLAGS:
├── FaZe
│   ├── Catastrophic Inferno (0-4) — must ban or guaranteed loss
│   ├── 1-5 in last 6 series — worst streak in recent memory
│   ├── broky at 1.00 rating — FaZe's AWPer is underperforming badly
│   ├── Ancient inconsistency (2-3, scores range from 13-3 to 4-13)
│   └── Lost to lower-ranked PARIVISION at PGL — confidence may be low
├── Astralis
│   ├── One-dimensional map pool (Overpass-dependent, 20% Mirage)
│   ├── 0-2 stomps by NAVI and FUT at PGL — no competitive maps
│   ├── HooXi fragging liability — effectively 4v5 in aim duels
│   ├── ryu relatively unproven at Major level
│   └── No top-tier wins in this window (only beat 3DMAX, fnatic)

X-FACTORS:
├── karrigan's elimination match experience — has been here many times
├── frozen on form (1.17) could carry FaZe on any map
├── Staehr (1.12) is Astralis's only hope to match FaZe's firepower
├── Ancient decider — both teams are volatile on it, anything can happen
└── First veto ban (Inferno vs Anubis) could unlock unexpected maps
```

## 11. Series Prediction

**Predicted Maps:**
- Map 1: Mirage (FaZe pick) → **FaZe wins 13-8**
- Map 2: Overpass (Astralis pick) → **Astralis wins 13-10**
- Map 3: Ancient (Decider) → **FaZe wins 13-11**

**Series Result:** FaZe wins **2-1**
**Confidence:** Medium

**Most Likely Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Probability | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| FaZe 2-0 | 25% | FaZe dominates Mirage + upsets on Overpass (they are 67% on it). Under 2.5 maps. |
| FaZe 2-1 | 35% | Split picks, FaZe takes Ancient decider on individual talent + H2H edge (13-7). Most likely outcome. |
| Astralis 2-1 | 25% | Astralis wins Overpass + steals Ancient (their 100% WR, albeit small sample). Upset special. |
| Astralis 2-0 | 15% | Requires Astralis winning Mirage (20% WR) — unlikely but elimination pressure could push them. |

**FaZe ML probability:** ~60%
**Astralis ML probability:** ~40%

**Reasoning:** FaZe's individual talent edge (frozen 1.17, Twistzz 1.12 vs only Staehr 1.12) and the massive Mirage mismatch (67% vs 20%) give them a structural advantage. The H2H, though thin, also favors FaZe (2-0, 13-4 Dust2, 13-7 Ancient). However, FaZe's terrible recent form (1-5) and Astralis's Overpass strength (75%) prevent this from being a high-confidence call. Both teams are struggling, making this match volatile.

## 12. Prediction vs Market

| Outcome | My Probability | Polymarket | Edge | Signal |
|---------|---------------|------------|------|--------|
| FaZe ML | 60% | 63.5% | -3.5% | No Value |
| Astralis ML | 40% | 36.5% | +3.5% | No Value |
| Map 1: FaZe | ~70% | 57.0% | +13% | **Value** (if Mirage) |
| Map 1: Astralis | ~30% | 43.0% | -13% | Fade |
| Over 2.5 maps | ~60% | 46.0% | +14% | **Value** |
| Under 2.5 maps | ~40% | 54.0% | -14% | Fade |
| FaZe -1.5 | ~25% | 36.0% | -11% | Fade |
| Astralis +1.5 | ~75% | 64.0% | +11% | **Value** |

**Value Plays:**

1. **Over 2.5 Maps at 46% (2.17 odds)** — My model says ~60%. The map pool structure strongly suggests a 2-1: FaZe should dominate Mirage (their pick vs Astralis's 20%), Astralis should win Overpass (their signature at 75%). The maps are well-defined enough that each team wins their pick most of the time. 14% edge exceeds the 10% threshold. **BEST BET.**

2. **Astralis +1.5 maps at 64% (1.56 odds)** — My model says ~75%. This is the inverse of the O/U — Astralis avoiding a 2-0 requires winning just one map, and Overpass at 75% gives them a strong path. 11% edge. Solid value.

3. **FaZe Map 1 at 57% (1.75 odds)** — If Map 1 is Mirage (FaZe's pick vs Astralis's 20%), my model says ~70%. However, per Principle #27, map-level value calls depend on predicting the correct map. If the veto goes differently and Map 1 isn't Mirage, this edge vanishes. **Conditional value — monitor veto before acting.**

**Market Efficiency Notes:**
- ML is efficiently priced — my model (60%) and Polymarket (63.5%) are within noise range. No edge either way.
- The O/U market appears mispriced — the structural map pool analysis strongly favors a 3-map series, yet the market favors Under. This is the clearest value opportunity.
- Map 2 market ($546 liquidity) is too thin to trade reliably — ignore per Principle #27.
