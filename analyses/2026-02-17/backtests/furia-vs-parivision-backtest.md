|------|--------|-----|-------|
| 1 | PRV ban | Nuke | Permaban ✅ |
| 2 | FURIA ban | Ancient | Permaban ✅ |
| 3 | PRV pick | **Dust2** | PRV's 83.3% signature |
| 4 | FURIA pick | **Inferno** | Surprise — not Mirage! |
| 5 | FURIA ban | Overpass | Remove PRV's option |

### Veto Prediction vs Actual

| Step | Predicted | Actual | Match? |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | FURIA ban Ancient | PRV ban Nuke | ❌ (order swapped) |
| 2 | PRV ban Nuke | FURIA ban Ancient | ❌ (order swapped) |
| 3 | FURIA pick Mirage | PRV pick Dust2 | ❌ (different team, different map) |
| 4 | PRV pick Dust2 | FURIA pick **Inferno** | ❌ (FURIA picked Inferno, not Mirage!) |
| 5 | FURIA ban Inferno | FURIA ban **Overpass** | ❌ (we predicted FURIA banning Inferno!) |
| 6 | PRV ban Overpass | PRV ban **Anubis** | ❌ |
| 7 | Decider: Anubis | Decider: **Mirage** | ❌ |

**Veto Score: 0/7** — Complete miss on every step. The fundamental error: we predicted FURIA would pick Mirage and ban Inferno. Instead, FURIA picked Inferno and left Mirage as the decider. This reshuffled the entire veto.

### Why FURIA Picked Inferno (The Surprise)

Our analysis specifically noted:
- "PRV beat FURIA 13-11 on Inferno at BLAST Bounty" (H2H loss)
- "FURIA ban Inferno — PRV is 60% on Inferno AND beat FURIA 13-11 on it in H2H"

FURIA did the OPPOSITE — they picked into the H2H loss map. Possible reasoning:
1. FURIA believed the 11-13 Inferno loss was fixable — a 2-round margin, not a blowout
2. FURIA's Inferno is ~50% but their recent PGL results on Inferno include 13-10 vs B8 — they've been playing it
3. By picking Inferno and leaving Mirage as decider, FURIA avoided having their primary map (Mirage) as a "pick" that PRV could anti-strat. As a decider, both teams prepare equally.
4. Per Principle #28 (opponents can steal your best map pick) — FURIA may have feared PRV would anti-strat their Mirage pick specifically, so they saved it as decider where PRV couldn't target-prepare.

**This is a sophisticated veto meta-game.** FURIA essentially said: "We'd rather pick Inferno (50% WR, H2H loss) and save Mirage as a decider than give PRV a known target to anti-strat."

## Map-by-Map Analysis

### Map 1: Dust2 (PRV Pick) — FURIA 16-14 OT

**Predicted:** PRV wins 13-7 (High confidence)
**Actual:** FURIA wins 16-14 OT
**Result:** ❌ Wrong winner — our highest confidence call was wrong (AGAIN)

This is the fourth time at PGL that a team's signature pick has been stolen:
- MOUZ stole FUT's 86% Mirage (13-8)
- Astralis stole FaZe's 67% Mirage (13-9)
- FURIA stole PRV's 83% Dust2 (16-14 OT)

**What happened:**
- Dead even through regulation: 6-6 first half, 6-6 second half (12-12)
- FURIA took OT 4-2, showing superior composure in clutch moments
- PRV's 83.3% Dust2 was supposed to be "effectively guaranteed" — it was anything but
- molodoy (Player of the Match) likely had a standout Dust2 performance

**Why our High confidence prediction failed:**
1. **Principle #31 (Map WR Quality-Adjusted) applies retroactively** — PRV's 83.3% was against mixed opposition. FURIA at #2 is significantly stronger than PRV's average Dust2 opponent.
2. **Principle #30 (Anti-Strat Tax)** — PRV picks Dust2 predictably. FURIA and their coaching staff had time to prepare specifically.
3. **FalleN is a Dust2 legend** — his career was built on this map. Even at 0.93 rating, his Dust2 knowledge is unmatched. We underweighted this.
4. **OT = 50/50** — Per Principle #16, a 12-12 tie is chaos. FURIA's experience edge matters most in OT.

### Map 2: Inferno (FURIA Pick) — PRV 16-14 OT

**Predicted:** We didn't predict this map at all (we had FURIA banning Inferno!)
**Actual:** PRV wins 16-14 OT — both picks stolen!
**Result:** N/A (unpredicted map)

**What happened:**
- FURIA led 7-5 at half (FURIA CT) → went 5-7 second half (T side struggles)
- 12-12 regulation → PRV took OT 4-2
- PRV stole FURIA's pick — the exact reverse of Map 1
- This confirms PRV's H2H edge on Inferno (now 2-0 vs FURIA, both close: 13-11 and 16-14)

**The irony:** FURIA deliberately picked Inferno despite the H2H loss (13-11 at BLAST Bounty). They lost again, also by 2 rounds in OT. The H2H on Inferno now stands at PRV 2-0 vs FURIA — both extremely close but PRV consistently finds the extra rounds.

### Map 3: Mirage (Decider) — FURIA 13-8

**Predicted:** We had Mirage as FURIA's pick (13-10). It ended up as the decider.
**Actual:** FURIA wins 13-8 decisively
**Result:** ✅ (correct winner on Mirage, though wrong context — decider vs pick)

**What happened:**
- 6-6 at half (dead even again — every map in this series was close at half)
- FURIA dominated the second half: **7-2** — completely shut down PRV's T side
- FURIA's Mirage expertise showed through when it mattered most

**Key insight:** FURIA's decision to save Mirage as decider rather than pick it WORKED. As a decider, both teams prepared equally — and FURIA's deeper Mirage experience (67%, 8-4) proved decisive. The 7-2 second half suggests FURIA made mid-half adjustments that PRV couldn't answer.

**H2H context:** PRV had beaten FURIA 13-8 on Mirage at BLAST Bounty. This time FURIA won 13-8 — exact inverse scoreline. FURIA clearly studied the loss and adjusted. The H2H on Mirage is now 1-1 between these teams.

## Market Call Assessment

| Market Call | Prediction | Polymarket | Actual | Result |
|-------------|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| FURIA ML | 57% (fade FURIA) | 66.5% | FURIA won 2-1 | N/A (no call on FURIA) |
| PRV ML | 43% (marginal value) | 33.5% | PRV lost 1-2 | ❌ (marginal, not formal call) |
| Over 2.5 maps | **VALUE** (65% vs 54.5%) | 54.5% | 3 maps (Over) | ✅ |
| PRV +1.5 | **BEST BET** (85% vs 61.5%) | 61.5% | PRV won 1 map | ✅ |
| Dust2 PRV | High confidence (~83%) | — | FURIA won 16-14 OT | ❌ (directional, not market call) |

**Market Calls: 2/2** — Both formal value calls hit! PRV +1.5 (BEST BET) and Over 2.5 (VALUE) both cashed. This is our best market performance of the tournament.

**Why the value calls worked this time:**
1. **PRV +1.5 was robust** — even though PRV lost Dust2 (their "guaranteed" map), they still won Inferno. The +1.5 thesis didn't depend on WHICH map PRV won, just that they'd win at least one. PRV's broad map pool (5 maps at 60%+) made this a structurally sound bet.
2. **Over 2.5 worked because BOTH picks were stolen** — neither team's pick held. The series went to three maps not because each team won their pick (our thesis) but because each team won the OTHER team's pick. The outcome was right for the wrong reason.

## Veto Meta-Game Lessons

### FURIA's Inferno Pick Was Strategically Sound (Even Though They Lost It)

Our model said FURIA should ban Inferno (H2H loss, PRV 60%). Instead FURIA picked it and saved Mirage as decider. The logic:

1. **Mirage as decider = equal preparation** — neither team has the "pick advantage" of targeted prep
2. **Inferno was a fixable loss** — FURIA lost 11-13, a 2-round margin. They believed (correctly) they could compete on it
3. **Anti-strat avoidance** — picking Mirage (FURIA's known primary) gives PRV a known target. Inferno as an unexpected pick creates uncertainty for PRV
4. **Even losing Inferno, the strategy worked** — FURIA won the series by winning the Mirage decider

**New insight for veto modeling:** Teams may deliberately pick a "weaker" map to save their best map as the decider, especially when the opponent has already beaten them on that best map in H2H. The decider is a level playing field — a pick is a target.

### Both Picks Stolen — The "Each Team Wins Their Pick" Assumption Is Dead

All three Feb 17 evening matches (this one, NAVI-MongolZ, and the earlier MOUZ-FUT) featured at least one stolen pick. In FURIA-PRV, BOTH picks were stolen:
- FURIA stole PRV's 83% Dust2
- PRV stole FURIA's Inferno

The model's core assumption for Over 2.5 — "each team wins their pick, so 3 maps" — is wrong mechanistically but sometimes right in outcome. The Over 2.5 hit here NOT because picks held, but because picks were stolen symmetrically.

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Teams Save Best Maps as Deciders to Avoid Anti-Strat

FURIA picking Inferno (H2H loss) over Mirage (primary map) is a new veto paradigm. When a team's primary map is known AND the opponent has beaten them on it in H2H, the team may save it as a decider rather than give the opponent a known target. Build this scenario into veto predictions when H2H includes a loss on the team's primary map.

### Lesson 2: "High Confidence" on Signature Maps Is Still Failing

PRV's Dust2 at 83.3% was our "High confidence" prediction. FURIA won it in OT. This is the third "High confidence" signature map call that failed today (FUT Mirage 86%, FaZe Mirage 67%, PRV Dust2 83%). Per Principle #33, High confidence requires form + stats + H2H alignment. Going forward: NEVER assign High confidence to a map prediction, period. The variance in individual CS2 maps is too high for >70% confidence on any single map outcome.

### Lesson 3: OT Goes to the More Experienced Team

Both OT maps in this series told the same story:
- Dust2 OT: FURIA 4-2 (experienced team won)
- Inferno OT: PRV 4-2 (PRV won their H2H advantage map)

FalleN's 20+ years of competitive CS and FURIA's IEM Krakow Finals experience gave them an edge in OT situations. When predicting close maps (per Principle #16's ~15% OT probability), apply a slight edge (~55-60%) to the more experienced team in OT scenarios.

### Lesson 4: +1.5 Underdog Is the Most Reliable Market Call

PRV +1.5 at 61.5% (model 85%) was our BEST BET and it hit. Across all backtests, +1.5 underdog calls have been our most reliable market play because they don't depend on predicting WHICH map the underdog wins. A team with a broad map pool or one elite map will almost always take at least 1 map in a BO3 against a comparable opponent. This should be the default "safest" call going forward.
