## Map-by-Map Analysis

### Map 1: Inferno (MongolZ Pick) — NAVI 13-3

MongolZ picked their best H2H map (2-1 vs NAVI on Inferno) and got demolished. NAVI won 9-3 on CT then 4-0 on T — MongolZ won zero T rounds. A complete shutout in the second half.

**Live assessment at the time:** NAVI winning MongolZ's pick 13-3 should lead to a sweep (per Principle #24, sweep probability ~55-60%). The market moved to NAVI 85.5% ML. This seemed correct.

**What actually happened:** MongolZ mentally reset completely (Principle #13 confirmed again).

### Map 2: Nuke (NAVI Pick) — MongolZ 13-7

**H2H pattern played out perfectly:** Both previous Nuke meetings were 13-3 blowouts (one each way). This time MongolZ dominated the T side 10-2 (not 9-0 as initially reported — data shows 10-2). NAVI clawed back 5 CT rounds but it wasn't enough.

NAVI lost their own pick — the second time today a team lost their Nuke pick (FUT also lost Overpass after a dominant first half). NAVI's 0-9 T start was catastrophic — you can't come back from that on Nuke even with CT advantage.

### Map 3: Mirage (Decider) — MongolZ 13-11

**This is the biggest upset of the day.** NAVI was 5-2 H2H on Mirage vs MongolZ. The H2H included:
- NAVI 16-13 (BLAST Lisbon)
- NAVI 13-9 (Thunderpick WC)
- NAVI 13-3 (IEM Katowice)
- NAVI 13-10 (PGL Copenhagen)
- MongolZ 13-6 (ESL Pro League S21)
- MongolZ 13-11 (PGL Astana)

NAVI led 7-5 at half on CT. We noted this was "decent but not dominant." MongolZ then went **8-4 on CT** in the second half to take it 13-11.

**Why H2H failed here:**
1. **cobrazera is new** (1 month, 15 maps) — per Principle #26 exception, roster changes discount H2H by ~30%. We noted this during live analysis but still expected NAVI to win.
2. **MongolZ's mental resilience** — coming back from 3-13 on their own pick to win two straight maps shows championship-level composure. Principle #13 (mental reset is the norm) held again.
3. **H2H streaks aren't infinite** — same lesson from FURIA-Falcons backtest. NAVI's 5-2 Mirage H2H was strong but not unbreakable, especially with a new player on MongolZ.
4. **Second-half T-side execution** — MongolZ went 8-4 on T side Mirage, showing their attack improved dramatically from the first half (5 T rounds). They likely made mid-match tactical adjustments.

## Live Analysis Assessment

Since we didn't have a pre-match analysis, here's how the live calls performed:

| Live Call | What I Said | Actual | Result |
|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| Series winner (post Map 1) | NAVI wins 2-0 or 2-1 | MongolZ 2-1 | ❌ |
| Map 2 Nuke | NAVI ~65-70% | MongolZ 13-7 | ❌ |
| Map 3 Mirage | NAVI ~70-75% (5-2 H2H) | MongolZ 13-11 | ❌ |
| Sweep assessment | "Per Principle #24, sweep probability ~55-60%" | 3 maps played | ❌ |
| Market efficiency | "No strong value plays — market priced correctly" | — | N/A |
| NAVI -1.5 at 52.5% | "Marginal value (~60%)" | MongolZ won 2-1 | ❌ |

**All live directional calls were wrong.** The 13-3 Inferno result created overconfidence in NAVI — both for the market (85.5%) and for our model. The lesson: a blowout on one map does NOT predict subsequent maps, especially when the losing team has elite individual talent and a new roster dynamic.

## Lessons Learned

### Principle #13 Is Ironclad — Mental Reset After Blowout Losses

MongolZ lost 3-13 on their own Inferno pick and immediately won the next two maps (13-7 Nuke, 13-11 Mirage). This is the strongest confirmation yet of Principle #13. At the top level, a devastating loss has ZERO predictive power for the next map. Stop adjusting probabilities based on "momentum" from map results.

### H2H With Roster Changes Is Unreliable

NAVI was 5-2 on Mirage H2H vs MongolZ — but the old MongolZ. cobrazera (new, 1 month) changes team dynamics, comms, and playstyle. Per Principle #26 exception, we should have discounted NAVI's Mirage H2H edge by ~30%. That would have put Mirage closer to 55-60% NAVI rather than 70-75%.

### Blowout Map 1 Results Create Market Overreaction

After NAVI's 13-3 Inferno, the market moved to 85.5% NAVI ML. This was an overreaction — the result reflected one map (MongolZ's worst H2H map at that), not the team's overall capability. Live markets overreact to blowouts even more than to close results. The pre-match Polymarket line (~70% NAVI based on slug pricing patterns) was likely closer to the true probability.

### Both Teams' Picks Can Fail

Both NAVI and MongolZ lost their own picks (NAVI lost Nuke, MongolZ lost Inferno). Neither team's "pick map" was safe. This challenges the "each team wins their pick" assumption that underpins Over 2.5 value calls. In this match, the decider was the only map that went to the "expected" side (based on H2H... except MongolZ won it, breaking the H2H).
