**Market Insights:**
- HLTV bookmakers average: MOUZ ~1.47 / FUT ~2.62 → MOUZ ~68% (higher than Polymarket's 63.5%)
- Map 2 liquidity is only $596 — completely unreliable pricing, ignore
- Under 2.5 slightly favored (53%) — market leans toward a 2-0 sweep
- Map 1 odds (55.5% MOUZ) are significantly lower than ML (63.5%) — market expects Map 1 to be competitive, possibly because FUT's pick could come first depending on veto order
- O/U and handicap markets have very low volume ($821 / $183) — thin but potentially exploitable

## 2. Team Overview

| Metric | MOUZ | FUT | Edge |
|--------|------|-----|------|
| HLTV Ranking | #4 (475pts) | #14 (122pts) | MOUZ |
| PGL Record | 2-1 (advancing) | 2-1 (advancing) | Even |
| IEM Krakow | 4th (beat FaZe, Falcons, G2) | QF exit (beat FURIA 2-0) | MOUZ |
| Avg Top Rating (3mo) | 1.10 (Spinx) | 1.17 (dziugss) | **FUT** |
| Team Avg Rating | ~1.03 | ~1.11 | **FUT** |
| Best Map WR | Overpass 80% | Mirage 86% | FUT |
| Experience | Veteran roster, multiple Majors | Ex-NAVI Junior, first Major | MOUZ |

**Critical Observation:** FUT's individual ratings are **better** across the board. dziugss (1.17), lauNX (1.14), dem0n (1.13) — three players above 1.10 — versus MOUZ where only Spinx (1.10) cracks that threshold. Brollan at 0.93 is a significant liability for MOUZ. This is a young, hungry FUT squad that has already upset FURIA (ranked #2 at the time) 2-0 at IEM Krakow.

| Dust2 | 37.5% | 3-5 | 40% | 2-3 | Even (both weak) |
| Anubis | N/A | 0-0 (permaban) | 0% | 0-4 | N/A |

⚠️ = Small sample (<3 maps)

### Map Classification

```
MOUZ MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Anubis (0 maps played in 3 months)
├── BEST MAP: Overpass (80%, 4-1 — signature + only reliable map without Inferno)
├── CRUTCH MAP: Inferno (62.5%, 5-3 — picked 86% of matches, but FUT permabans it)
├── AVERAGE: Mirage (40%, 2-3 — beat NAVI 13-7 but lost to Aurora/Spirit badly)
├── WEAK: Dust2 (37.5%, 3-5), Nuke (33%, 1-2)
└── UNKNOWN: Ancient (100%, 1-0 — single map vs NRG)

FUT MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Inferno (0 maps played — removes MOUZ's crutch for free!)
├── BEST MAP: Mirage (86%, 6-1 — dominant, including 13-4 vs Astralis, 13-6 vs Aurora)
├── STRONG: Ancient (75%, 3-1 — secondary pick)
├── COMFORTABLE: Overpass (60%, 3-2 — includes 13-7 win over Astralis)
├── AVERAGE: Nuke (50%, 1-1 ⚠️)
├── WEAK: Dust2 (40%, 2-3 — collapses on this map)
└── CRISIS: Anubis (0%, 0-4 — consistently loses, even blew 12-7 lead vs Aurora)
```

### Structural Veto Advantage: FUT

This matchup has a rare permaban alignment that massively benefits FUT:
- **FUT's permaban (Inferno) removes MOUZ's strongest map.** MOUZ picks Inferno in 86% of their matches. Without it, their map pool shrinks to essentially just Overpass.
- **MOUZ's permaban (Anubis) removes FUT's worst map.** FUT is 0-4 on Anubis — they would never play it anyway. MOUZ's ban is wasted.

This asymmetry means FUT gets a "free" ban that actually hurts MOUZ, while MOUZ's ban doesn't hurt FUT at all. In a BO3 with 4 bans total, this is a significant structural edge for FUT.

## 4. Predicted Map Veto

**PREDICTED VETO:**

1. **BAN: MOUZ bans Anubis** — Permaban. MOUZ has banned Anubis in 100% of matches (7/7 tracked). Non-negotiable.

2. **BAN: FUT bans Inferno** — Permaban. FUT has banned Inferno in 100% of matches (10+/10+). This also removes MOUZ's go-to pick, a devastating side effect.

3. **PICK: MOUZ picks Overpass** — Without Inferno, Overpass (80%, 4-1) is MOUZ's only strong map. They must pick it. FUT is 60% on Overpass, so this isn't a free map, but MOUZ has the better record.

4. **PICK: FUT picks Mirage** — FUT's signature (86%, 6-1). MOUZ is only 40% on Mirage. Massive edge for FUT. FUT picks Mirage in ~60% of their matches.

5. **BAN: MOUZ bans Ancient** — FUT's second-strongest map (75%, 3-1). MOUZ has banned Ancient in multiple recent matches (vs NAVI, vs Spirit). Removing this forces a weaker decider for FUT.

6. **BAN: FUT bans Dust2** — FUT is 40% on Dust2 (2-3) with some ugly losses (5-13 vs 3DMAX). MOUZ is also bad (37.5%) but has more reps. FUT removes the graveyard map to leave Nuke.

7. **DECIDER: Nuke** — MOUZ 33% (1-2) vs FUT 50% (1-1). Both have tiny samples. MOUZ lost 2-13 to 3DMAX and 6-13 to BC.Game on Nuke. FUT won 13-9 vs Liquid but lost 2-13 vs Astralis. A true wildcard map.

**Alternative Scenario (if MOUZ bans Dust2 instead of Ancient):**
5. MOUZ ban Dust2 → 6. FUT ban Nuke → 7. Decider: Ancient (MOUZ 1-0 tiny sample vs FUT 75% 3-1). Favors FUT even more.

## 5. Map-by-Map Breakdown

### Map 1: Overpass (MOUZ Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- MOUZ: 80% (4-1) — Won 13-3 vs PARIVISION, 16-13 OT vs G2, 13-5 vs Heroic*, 13-8 vs FURIA*. Sole loss undetermined.
- FUT: 60% (3-2) — Won 13-7 vs Astralis (PGL R3!), 13-6 vs Aurora, 13-5 vs FURIA. Lost 18-22 OT vs FURIA, 11-13 vs Astralis (IEM).

**Key Dynamics:**
- MOUZ's Overpass is their identity map when Inferno isn't available. 80% WR is strong but only 5 maps.
- FUT just beat Astralis 13-7 on Overpass at PGL R3 — they're confident on this map.
- FUT's 18-22 OT loss to FURIA shows they can compete on Overpass even in tough matches.
- No H2H data on any map — this is a first meeting.

**Predicted Score:** MOUZ wins **13-9**
**Confidence:** Medium
**Key Factor:** MOUZ's higher Overpass WR and home-map comfort should prevail, but FUT's recent 13-7 Overpass win shows they won't roll over. Expect a competitive first half.

### Map 2: Mirage (FUT Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- FUT: 86% (6-1) — 13-6 vs Aurora, 13-9 vs FURIA, 13-4 vs Astralis, 13-11 vs FURIA (IEM), 13-7 vs Astralis (IEM). Sole loss: 9-13 vs G2.
- MOUZ: 40% (2-3) — Won 13-7 vs NAVI, 13-5 vs FaZe. Lost 5-13 vs Aurora, 3-13 vs Spirit, and one more.

**Key Dynamics:**
- FUT is ELITE on Mirage — 86% across 7 maps is exceptional. They've beaten FURIA twice on it and destroyed Astralis.
- MOUZ's Mirage results are polarized: dominant wins (13-7 NAVI, 13-5 FaZe) mixed with embarrassing losses (3-13 Spirit, 5-13 Aurora).
- When MOUZ loses on Mirage, they lose badly. Spirit and Aurora are not MOUZ's caliber, yet they got demolished.
- FUT's only Mirage loss (9-13 vs G2) was against a team known for Mirage strength.

**Predicted Score:** FUT wins **13-8**
**Confidence:** High
**Key Factor:** FUT's 86% Mirage is the strongest single-map advantage in this entire matchup. Even MOUZ's occasional Mirage magic (vs NAVI) doesn't change that FUT has been dominant here against better opponents. dziugss (1.17) and dem0n (1.13) should feast.

### Map 3: Nuke (Decider)

**Historical Performance:**
- MOUZ: 33% (1-2) — Lost 2-13 vs 3DMAX, 6-13 vs BC.Game at IEM. Won 13-6 (Budapest).
- FUT: 50% (1-1) — Won 13-9 vs Liquid. Lost 2-13 vs Astralis.

**Key Dynamics:**
- Both teams have catastrophic losses on Nuke (MOUZ 2-13, FUT 2-13). Neither is comfortable.
- Per Principle #10: All Nuke stats here are unreliable (2-3 maps each). This is genuinely unpredictable.
- Nuke is heavily CT-sided — whoever wins both pistol rounds and establishes CT economy will likely take the map.
- No H2H exists to break the tie.
- MOUZ's experience edge matters most on an uncomfortable, chaotic map. torzsi's AWP is more impactful on Nuke's vertical gameplay.

**Predicted Score:** MOUZ wins **13-11**
**Confidence:** Low
**Key Factor:** Pure coinflip. Giving MOUZ the slightest edge due to: (a) more experience in pressure situations, (b) torzsi's AWP on Nuke's long sightlines, (c) IGL xertioN/sycrone likely has more Nuke prep than FUT's young roster. But FUT's individual firepower could easily flip this.

## 6. Player Matchups

### Star Player Comparison

| Player | Team | Rating (3mo) | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------|------|-------|
| dziugss | FUT | **1.17** | Rifler | 17 years old, highest-rated player in this matchup |
| lauNX | FUT | **1.14** | AWPer | Strong fragging AWP, Romanian (home crowd at Cluj!) |
| dem0n | FUT | **1.13** | Rifler | Consistent support firepower |
| Spinx | MOUZ | **1.10** | Rifler | MOUZ's best performer |
| Krabeni | FUT | **1.07** | Entry | Player of the Match in 4+ series at IEM Krakow |
| xertioN | MOUZ | **1.06** | Rifler | Solid but unspectacular |
| torzsi | MOUZ | **1.05** | AWPer | MOUZ's primary AWP |
| cmtry | FUT | **1.05** | Rifler | Consistent baseline |
| Jimpphat | MOUZ | **1.00** | Rifler | Below expectations for a star |
| Brollan | MOUZ | **0.93** | Rifler | Significant slump — 5th man liability |

**Individual Talent Assessment:**
FUT has a **clear individual rating advantage**. Three players above 1.10 (dziugss 1.17, lauNX 1.14, dem0n 1.13) vs MOUZ's one (Spinx 1.10). FUT's average team rating (~1.11) significantly exceeds MOUZ's (~1.03). Brollan at 0.93 is MOUZ's weakest link and could be a decisive factor on close maps.

**AWP Matchup:**
- MOUZ AWPer: torzsi (1.05) — Experienced, consistent but not flashy.
- FUT AWPer: lauNX (1.14) — Higher-rated, Romanian playing on home soil in Cluj.
- **Edge:** FUT — lauNX's rating is significantly higher and he'll have crowd support.

**IGL Comparison:**
- MOUZ: sycrone (coach) + xertioN coordinate tactics. Veteran system.
- FUT: coolio (coach, ex-NAVI Junior system). Young squad, aggressive style.
- **Tactical Edge:** MOUZ — more experience adapting mid-series in BO3.

## 7. Recent Form

### MOUZ Recent Results

| Date | Opponent | Score | Event | Key Maps |
|------|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Feb 16 | Vitality | **0-2 L** | PGL Cluj R3 | Dust2 5-13 L, Inferno 8-13 L |
| Feb 15 | NAVI | **2-0 W** | PGL Cluj R2 | Inferno 13-9 W, Mirage 13-7 W |
| Feb 14 | PARIVISION | **2-1 W** | PGL Cluj R1 | Dust2 7-13 L, Inferno 13-7 W, Overpass 13-3 W |
| Feb ~7 | Spirit | **0-2 L** | IEM Krakow 3rd | Dust2 8-13 L, Mirage 3-13 L |
| Feb ~5 | Vitality | **0-2 L** | IEM Krakow SF | Nuke 7-13 L, Dust2 6-13 L |
| Feb ~4 | G2 | **2-0 W** | IEM Krakow QF | Overpass 16-13 W, Dust2 13-7 W |

**Form Assessment:** MOUZ is **Mixed** — strong wins over NAVI (2-0) and G2 (2-0), but consistent 0-2 losses to Vitality (twice) and Spirit. They beat lower-ranked teams convincingly but struggle against the elite. Dust2 remains a bleeding point (3-5).

### FUT Recent Results

| Date | Opponent | Score | Event | Key Maps |
|------|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Feb 16 | Astralis | **2-0 W** | PGL Cluj R3 | Overpass 13-7 W, Mirage 13-4 W |
| Feb 15 | FURIA | **1-2 L** | PGL Cluj R2 | Mirage 13-9 W, Overpass 18-22 L (OT), Anubis 9-13 L |
| Feb 14 | Aurora | **2-1 W** | PGL Cluj R1 | Mirage 13-6 W, Anubis 13-16 L (OT), Overpass 13-6 W |
| Feb ~2 | Astralis | **1-2 L** | IEM Krakow | Mirage 13-7 W, Overpass 11-13 L, Nuke 2-13 L |
| Feb ~1 | G2 | **0-2 L** | IEM Krakow UB SF | Mirage 9-13 L, Dust2 9-13 L |
| Jan ~31 | FURIA | **2-0 W** | IEM Krakow S2 | Mirage 13-11 W, Dust2 13-6 W |

**Form Assessment:** FUT is **Hot** — beat Astralis 2-0 dominantly at PGL, beat FURIA 2-0 at IEM Krakow (massive upset). Their Mirage is nearly unbeatable (6-1). Losses have been to top-tier teams (G2, Vitality-level FURIA, Astralis in BO3). This is a team on the rise, playing their first Major with nothing to lose.

---

## 8. Head-to-Head History

**No previous meetings.** This is the first time MOUZ and FUT have faced each other.

Without H2H, we rely entirely on map pool analysis, individual stats, and form. Per Principle #1, H2H would normally be the strongest predictor — its absence increases uncertainty.

---

## 9. Tournament Context

- **Event:** PGL Cluj-Napoca 2026 (Major)
- **Stage:** Swiss Stage, Round 4 (2-1 bracket)
- **Format:** BO3
- **Stakes:** Winner advances to 3-1 and **qualifies for the Legends stage (playoffs)**. Loser drops to 2-2 and faces another BO3 to survive.
- **MOUZ's Path:** Beat PARIVISION 2-1 (R1), beat NAVI 2-0 (R2), lost to Vitality 0-2 (R3). Impressive R2 win; only lost to the #1 team.
- **FUT's Path:** Beat Aurora 2-1 (R1), lost to FURIA 1-2 (R2), beat Astralis 2-0 (R3). Dominant R3 performance; their best match of the tournament.
- **Pressure:** Lower than elimination matches — the loser isn't out. But qualifying for playoffs is a massive carrot, especially for FUT's first Major.
- **Crowd Factor:** LAN in Romania. **lauNX is Romanian** — potential home crowd boost for FUT.
- **Narrative:** FUT is the underdog story of this Major. Former NAVI Junior core, youngest average age in the tournament, playing fearless CS.

## 10. Red Flags & X-Factors

```
RED FLAGS:
├── MOUZ
│   ├── Inferno banned for free — FUT's permaban removes MOUZ's crutch map
│   ├── Brollan at 0.93 rating — significant individual liability
│   ├── Dust2 weakness (3-5, 37.5%) could matter if veto goes wrong
│   ├── Back-to-back 0-2 losses to VIT and Spirit show ceiling issues
│   └── Without Inferno, map pool shrinks to essentially "Overpass + pray"
├── FUT
│   ├── Anubis 0-4 — if this map surfaces, it's an auto-loss
│   ├── Nuke volatility (13-9 win then 2-13 loss)
│   ├── Young roster (17-20 years) — first Major, less experience in pressure
│   ├── No H2H — unfamiliar opponent, can't scout-prepare
│   └── Lost to G2 0-2 at IEM Krakow — struggles vs disciplined teams

X-FACTORS:
├── dziugss (17 years old, 1.17 rating) — potential breakout star performance
├── lauNX — Romanian AWPer playing at home in Cluj. Crowd factor.
├── MOUZ's veteran experience in BO3 adaptation (coaching edge)
├── FUT's Mirage dominance (86%) — almost guaranteed to win their pick
├── Nuke decider would be chaos — both teams have 2-13 losses on it
└── If FUT wins, they make playoffs at their first Major — legacy moment
```

## 11. Series Prediction

**Predicted Maps:**
- Map 1: Overpass (MOUZ pick) → **MOUZ wins 13-9**
- Map 2: Mirage (FUT pick) → **FUT wins 13-8**
- Map 3: Nuke (Decider) → **MOUZ wins 13-11**

**Series Result:** MOUZ wins **2-1**
**Confidence:** Low-Medium

**Most Likely Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Probability | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| MOUZ 2-1 | 30% | Split picks, MOUZ takes Nuke decider on experience edge. Most likely single outcome. |
| FUT 2-1 | 25% | Split picks, FUT steals Nuke on individual firepower (dziugss/lauNX). Very plausible. |
| MOUZ 2-0 | 20% | MOUZ wins Overpass + steals Mirage (they did beat NAVI on Mirage). Requires FUT's Mirage to crack. |
| FUT 2-0 | 25% | FUT wins Mirage + steals Overpass (they're 60% on it, just beat Astralis 13-7). Bold but this team has proven upset capability. |

**MOUZ ML probability:** ~58%
**FUT ML probability:** ~42%

**Reasoning:** This match is closer than the rankings suggest. FUT has:
1. **Better individual ratings** across the board (1.11 avg vs 1.03 avg)
2. **A free structural veto advantage** — their Inferno permaban removes MOUZ's best map
3. **The strongest single-map edge** — Mirage at 86% is nearly guaranteed
4. **Proven upset capability** — beat #2 FURIA 2-0 at IEM Krakow

MOUZ has:
1. **More experience** at the highest level and in BO3 adaptation
2. **Overpass at 80%** — their one reliable map
3. **Stronger coaching and mid-series adjustment** (sycrone system)
4. **Higher ranking pedigree** (#4 vs #14)

The series hinges on the decider. Without H2H data and with both teams volatile on Nuke, this is genuinely a coinflip that I'm giving to MOUZ by the slimmest of margins based on experience.

## 12. Prediction vs Market

| Outcome | My Probability | Polymarket | Edge | Signal |
|---------|---------------|------------|------|--------|
| MOUZ ML | 58% | 63.5% | -5.5% | No Value |
| FUT ML | 42% | 36.5% | +5.5% | Marginal (below 10% threshold) |
| Map 1: MOUZ | ~65% | 55.5% | +9.5% | **Marginal Value** (if Overpass) |
| Map 1: FUT | ~35% | 44.5% | -9.5% | Fade |
| Over 2.5 maps | ~65% | 47.0% | +18% | **STRONG VALUE** |
| Under 2.5 maps | ~35% | 53.0% | -18% | Fade |
| FUT +1.5 maps | ~80% | 63.5% | +16.5% | **STRONG VALUE** |
| MOUZ -1.5 maps | ~20% | 36.5% | -16.5% | Fade |

**Value Plays:**

1. **Over 2.5 Maps at 47% (2.13 odds) — BEST BET.** My model says ~65%. Each team has a dominant pick map (MOUZ Overpass 80%, FUT Mirage 86%). The probability of both teams winning their pick is very high (~52% just from multiplying pick-map WRs). The market is pricing a sweep at 53% — far too high given the map pool specialization. 18% edge exceeds every threshold. This is the clearest value in the match.

2. **FUT +1.5 Maps at 63.5% (1.57 odds) — STRONG VALUE.** My model says ~80%. FUT's Mirage at 86% makes it extremely unlikely they get swept. Even MOUZ's best Mirage performances (13-7 vs NAVI) don't match FUT's consistency. For MOUZ to 2-0, they'd need to beat FUT on their 86% map — improbable. 16.5% edge.

3. **FUT ML at 36.5% (2.74 odds)** — My model says 42%. Edge is 5.5%, below the 10% threshold from Principle #27. Per the principle, I won't call this "value" without H2H support (no H2H exists). However, if you believe FUT's individual firepower and veto advantage matter more than MOUZ's experience, FUT at 2.74 is worth a look.

**Market Efficiency Notes:**
- The ML market overvalues MOUZ by ~5.5% — driven by ranking prestige (#4 vs #14). The market hasn't fully accounted for FUT's structural veto advantage (Inferno permaban) and individual rating superiority.
- The O/U market is significantly mispriced. Both teams' map pools are specialized enough that a 3-map series is the most likely outcome.
- FUT is a dangerous underdog — they've beaten FURIA (#2) and Astralis, and their Mirage gives them a guaranteed path to at least 1 map win.
