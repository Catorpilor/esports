- Map 1 and Map 2 have near-zero volume — wide bid-ask spreads (0.53–0.68), unreliable
- Over 2.5 slightly favored (54.5%) — market leans toward a 3-map series
- O/U and handicap markets are extremely thin ($1.3K / $36) — pricing may be stale
- There's a notable discrepancy between Polymarket (66.5%) and HLTV books (~70%) — Polymarket is giving PRV slightly more respect

| Metric | FURIA | PARIVISION | Edge |
|--------|-------|------------|------|
| HLTV Ranking | #2 (749pts) | #6 (325pts) | FURIA |
| PGL Record | 2-1 | 2-1 | Even |
| Recent Event Peak | IEM Krakow Finals (2nd) | BLAST Bounty Winner (1st) | FURIA |
| H2H (Recent) | **Lost 0-2** | **Won 2-0** (BLAST Bounty SF) | **PARIVISION** |
| Star Players (Rating) | KSCERATO 1.15, molodoy 1.15 | nota 1.10, xiELO 1.09 | FURIA |
| IGL Experience | FalleN (legendary, 0.93 rating) | Jame (experienced, 1.08 rating) | FURIA (legacy) / PRV (fragging) |
| Best Map WR | Mirage ~67% | Dust2 83.3% | PRV (higher % on best map) |

**Critical Observation:** PARIVISION beat FURIA 2-0 at BLAST Bounty S1 Finals (Inferno 13-11, Mirage 13-8). Per Principle #1 (H2H > Map Stats), this is the strongest signal. PRV won on FURIA's own Mirage — that's a major red flag for FURIA's pick.

## 3. Map Pool Analysis

### Map Pool Matrix (Dec 2025 — Feb 2026)

| Map | FURIA W% | FURIA Record | PRV W% | PRV Record | Advantage |
|-----|----------|-------------|--------|------------|-----------|
| Dust2 | ~40% | ~2-3 | **83.3%** | 10-2 | **PRV (massive)** |
| Mirage | ~67% | ~8-4 | 60% | 6-4 | FURIA (but H2H loss) |
| Inferno | ~50% | ~4-4 | 60% | 6-4 | PRV (+ H2H win) |
| Nuke | ~57% | ~4-3 | N/A | 0-0 (permaban) | FURIA (but banned by PRV) |
| Overpass | ~60% | ~3-2 | 50% | 4-4 | FURIA |
| Anubis | ~50% | ~2-2 | 66.7% | 2-1⚠️ | PRV (small sample) |
| Ancient | ~33% | ~1-2 | 60% | 6-4 | PRV |

⚠️ = Small sample (<3 maps)

### Map Classification

```
FURIA MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Ancient (~33%, consistently banned)
├── BEST MAP: Mirage (~67%, primary pick — but lost 8-13 to PRV in H2H!)
├── STRONG: Nuke (~57% — but PRV permabans it, removed for free)
├── COMFORTABLE: Overpass (~60%)
├── AVERAGE: Inferno (~50%), Anubis (~50%)
└── WEAK: Dust2 (~40% — PRV's 83% map)

PARIVISION MAP POOL:
├── PERMABAN: Nuke (0 maps played — removes FURIA's strong Nuke for free)
├── ELITE MAP: Dust2 (83.3%, 10-2 — signature, opponents forced to ban or concede)
├── STRONG: Mirage (60%, H2H 13-8 over FURIA), Inferno (60%, H2H 13-11 over FURIA)
├── COMFORTABLE: Ancient (60%, 6-4), Anubis (66.7%, 2-1 ⚠️)
├── AVERAGE: Overpass (50%, 4-4)
└── NEVER PLAYED: Nuke (permaban)
```

### Structural Veto Dynamics

Similar to the MOUZ-FUT matchup, there's a permaban asymmetry:
- **PRV's Nuke permaban removes FURIA's secondary strong map** (Nuke ~57%). FURIA loses a competitive map for free.
- **FURIA's Ancient permaban doesn't hurt PRV much** — Ancient is one of PRV's good maps (60%) but not their best.

PARIVISION also has a unique weapon: **Dust2 at 83.3% (10-2)** forces opponents to either ban it (wasting a ban) or concede the map. At PGL, FaZe specifically broke their normal veto to ban PRV's Dust2 (Principle #18). FURIA can't afford to do this — they need their bans for Ancient and Inferno/Anubis.

**PRV's map pool is broader than FURIA's.** PRV has 5 maps at 60%+ (Dust2, Anubis, Mirage, Inferno, Ancient). FURIA has 3 (Mirage, Overpass, Nuke — and Nuke is permabanned by PRV). This gives PRV a structural BO3 advantage.

---

## 4. Predicted Map Veto

**PREDICTED VETO:**

1. **BAN: FURIA bans Ancient** — Permaban. FURIA's worst map (~33%), banned in virtually every series.

2. **BAN: PRV bans Nuke** — Permaban. 0 maps played in 3 months. Also removes FURIA's secondary strong map.

3. **PICK: FURIA picks Mirage** — FURIA's primary map (~67%). Despite losing 8-13 to PRV on Mirage in H2H, FURIA has no better option — Overpass (~60%) is their only alternative and PRV is also competitive there. FURIA will trust their Mirage prep and hope the H2H loss was an outlier.

4. **PICK: PRV picks Dust2** — PRV's signature (83.3%, 10-2). FURIA is ~40% on Dust2. This is near-guaranteed for PRV. At PGL, PRV won Dust2 13-7 vs MOUZ, 13-4 vs G2. Only NAVI edged them 13-11 on Dust2.

5. **BAN: FURIA bans Inferno** — PRV is 60% on Inferno AND beat FURIA 13-11 on it in H2H. FURIA's own Inferno is inconsistent (~50%). Removing the H2H threat map.

6. **BAN: PRV bans Overpass** — FURIA's second-best active map (~60%). PRV is only 50% on Overpass (4-4) and got destroyed 3-13 by MOUZ on it at PGL R1. Remove FURIA's comfort pick.

7. **DECIDER: Anubis** — FURIA ~50% (2-2). PRV 66.7% (2-1, small sample). No H2H on Anubis.

**Alternative Scenario (FURIA bans Anubis instead of Inferno):**
5. FURIA ban Anubis → 6. PRV ban Overpass → 7. Decider: Inferno. PRV has H2H win (13-11) and 60% WR on Inferno. Even worse for FURIA.

**Alternative Scenario 2 (FURIA picks Overpass instead of Mirage):**
3. FURIA pick Overpass (60%) → 4. PRV pick Dust2 (83%) → 5. FURIA ban Inferno → 6. PRV ban Mirage → 7. Decider: Anubis. This avoids the H2H Mirage trap but gives up FURIA's best map.

## 5. Map-by-Map Breakdown

### Map 1: Mirage (FURIA Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- FURIA: ~67% (~8-4) — Won 16-14 vs Falcons (PGL R3), 13-11 vs B8, 13-4 vs Aurora (IEM), 13-11 vs Vitality (IEM GF). Lost 9-13 vs FUT (PGL R2).
- PRV: 60% (6-4) — Won 13-8 vs FURIA (H2H!), 13-8 vs G2, 13-5 vs Aurora (IEM). Lost 2-13 vs FaZe (PGL R3).

**H2H on Mirage:** PRV won **13-8** vs FURIA at BLAST Bounty Finals.

**Key Dynamics:**
- Per Principle #1 (H2H > Map Stats): PRV won this exact map vs this exact opponent 13-8. That's a 5-round margin — not a fluke.
- However, it's only 1 data point. FURIA's overall Mirage record (67%) is strong and includes wins vs Vitality and Falcons.
- PRV's 2-13 loss to FaZe on Mirage (PGL R3) shows they can also collapse on this map.
- FURIA will have studied the H2H loss and adjusted — but PRV's Mirage fundamentals are solid (60%).

**Predicted Score:** FURIA wins **13-10**
**Confidence:** Medium
**Key Factor:** Despite the H2H loss, FURIA's deeper Mirage experience and KSCERATO/molodoy duo (both 1.15) should make the difference. But expect a competitive match — PRV won't roll over. This could easily go the other way.

### Map 2: Dust2 (PRV Pick)

**Historical Performance:**
- PRV: 83.3% (10-2) — Won 13-7 vs MOUZ, 13-4 vs G2, 16-13 vs Astralis, 13-4 vs Aurora. Losses: 11-13 vs NAVI, and one other.
- FURIA: ~40% (~2-3) — Dust2 is FURIA's weakest active map. Lost to NAVI at Budapest, lost to Spirit 8-13 at IEM.

**Key Dynamics:**
- This is PRV's elite map. 83.3% across 12 maps is exceptional — the largest sample size and highest WR of any map for either team.
- Per Principle #18: opponents should consider banning Dust2 when facing PRV (>80% WR). FURIA can't afford to because they need their Ancient ban.
- Jame's AWP on Dust2's long sightlines is devastating. PRV's round win% after first kill on Dust2 is 80.1%.
- FURIA's only realistic hope is winning both pistol rounds and building an early economy lead.

**Predicted Score:** PRV wins **13-7**
**Confidence:** High
**Key Factor:** PRV's 83.3% Dust2 is the strongest statistical edge in this entire matchup. FURIA's ~40% Dust2 can't compete. This is effectively a guaranteed map for PRV.

### Map 3: Anubis (Decider)

**Historical Performance:**
- FURIA: ~50% (~2-2) — Won 13-9 vs FUT (PGL R2). Lost 11-13 vs Falcons (PGL R3).
- PRV: 66.7% (2-1) — Won 19-16 OT vs NAVI (IEM Krakow, impressive). Lost 5-13 vs Aurora. Small sample.

**No H2H on Anubis.**

**Key Dynamics:**
- Both teams have limited and volatile Anubis data. PRV's 19-16 OT win over NAVI is elite-level, but the 5-13 loss to Aurora shows wild inconsistency.
- FURIA's Anubis is middling — they won a comfortable 13-9 vs FUT but lost 11-13 in a close decider vs Falcons.
- Per Principle #10 (Small Sample Skepticism): Neither team's Anubis stats are reliable with 2-3 maps each.
- This is a genuine coinflip. PRV's slightly higher WR and the fact that FURIA has never played Anubis against PRV removes any H2H guidance.
- FURIA's experience edge (FalleN IGL, Major veterans) matters most in chaotic deciders.

**Predicted Score:** FURIA wins **16-14 OT**
**Confidence:** Low
**Key Factor:** Genuine coinflip. Giving FURIA the slightest edge based on: (a) KSCERATO and molodoy performing at 1.15 rating, (b) FalleN's experience calling on pressure maps, (c) FURIA's IEM Krakow run proves they can win close deciders (16-13 vs Spirit on Mirage). But PRV's 19-16 Anubis win over NAVI shows they're equally capable in OT.

## 6. Player Matchups

### Star Player Comparison

| Player | Team | Rating (3mo) | Role | Notes |
|--------|------|-------------|------|-------|
| KSCERATO | FURIA | **1.15** | Rifler (star) | FURIA's best — consistent anchor |
| molodoy | FURIA | **1.15** | AWP/Secondary | Strong performer, stars in OT clutches |
| nota | PRV | **1.10** | Rifler | 1.50 rating in BLAST Bounty Grand Final |
| xiELO | PRV | **1.09** | Rifler | PotM vs FaZe at PGL R3 |
| Jame | PRV | **1.08** | IGL/AWP | Legendary AWPer; controlled style |
| zweih | PRV | **1.07** | Rifler | New addition (1 month), 33 maps only |
| YEKINDAR | FURIA | **1.04** | Entry | Former Liquid star, aggressive style |
| BELCHONOKK | PRV | **0.98** | Support | Steady but lower-rated |
| yuurih | FURIA | **0.95** | Lurk | In a slump — below career average |
| FalleN | FURIA | **0.93** | IGL/AWP | Legendary IGL, but fragging is a liability |

**Individual Talent Assessment:**
FURIA has the higher individual ceiling (KSCERATO + molodoy both at 1.15), but also has two players below 1.00 (yuurih 0.95, FalleN 0.93). PRV's ratings are more compressed — no standout star but all 5 players between 0.98-1.10. PRV's team is more balanced; FURIA is more top-heavy.

**AWP Matchup:**
- FURIA: FalleN (0.93) — Legendary but declining. molodoy (1.15) may share AWP duties.
- PRV: Jame (1.08) — One of CS's most famous AWPers. Passive, save-oriented style but incredibly effective on Dust2.
- **Edge:** PRV — Jame at 1.08 significantly outperforms FalleN at 0.93. On Dust2 specifically, Jame is elite.

**IGL Comparison:**
- FURIA: FalleN — All-time CS legend. Multiple Major wins. Adaptive, experienced.
- PRV: Jame — Experienced CIS IGL. Known for methodical, economy-focused approach.
- **Tactical Edge:** Even — both are veteran IGLs. FalleN has more Major experience but Jame has led PRV to beat G2 and FaZe at this event.

| Jan ~24 | **PARIVISION** | **0-2 L** | BLAST Bounty SF | Inferno 11-13 L, Mirage 8-13 L |

**Form Assessment:** FURIA is **Mixed-Hot** — IEM Krakow finalist, beat Spirit in a thriller SF. At PGL, their R2 triple-OT win over FUT (22-18) showed incredible resilience. But lost to Falcons in R3 and got swept by Vitality in the IEM GF. **Crucially lost 0-2 to PARIVISION** at BLAST Bounty in their most recent meeting.

### PARIVISION Recent Results

| Date | Opponent | Score | Event | Key Maps |
|------|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Feb 16 | FaZe | **2-1 W** | PGL Cluj R3 | Mirage 2-13 L, Ancient 13-11 W, Inferno 13-9 W |
| Feb 15 | G2 | **2-1 W** | PGL Cluj R2 | Mirage 13-8 W, Inferno 13-8 W, Dust2 13-4 W |
| Feb 14 | MOUZ | **1-2 L** | PGL Cluj R1 | Dust2 13-7 W, Inferno 7-13 L, Overpass 3-13 L |
| Feb ~1 | Astralis | **1-2 L** | IEM Krakow | Dust2 16-13 W, Overpass 11-13 L, Ancient 7-13 L |
| Jan ~31 | NAVI | **1-2 L** | IEM Krakow | Dust2 11-13 L, Anubis 19-16 W (OT), Ancient 5-13 L |
| Jan 25 | **FURIA** | **2-0 W** | BLAST Bounty SF | Inferno 13-11 W, Mirage 13-8 W |

**Form Assessment:** PARIVISION is **Hot** — won BLAST Bounty (swept Falcons 3-0 in final), beat G2 and FaZe at PGL Cluj. Their only PGL loss was to #4 MOUZ (1-2, close on Dust2). zweih has integrated well despite being new (1 month). The team is playing fearless CS, taking down top-10 opponents regularly. **Beat FURIA 2-0** in their last meeting.

## 8. Head-to-Head History

| Date | Event | Winner | Score | Maps |
|------|-------|--------|-------|------|
| Jan 24, 2026 | BLAST Bounty S1 Finals SF | **PARIVISION** | **2-0** | Inferno 13-11, Mirage 13-8 |

**H2H Pattern:** Only 1 meeting, but PARIVISION won convincingly — taking BOTH maps, including FURIA's primary pick (Mirage). Per Principle #1 (H2H > Map Stats > Individual Skill), this is a significant signal. PRV didn't just win — they beat FURIA on FURIA's best map.

**H2H Limitations:** Only 2 maps in H2H. Per Principle #10, this is too thin to fully override raw map stats. However, the direction is clear: PRV has FURIA's number, at least as of late January 2026.

---

## 9. Tournament Context

- **Event:** PGL Cluj-Napoca 2026 (Major)
- **Stage:** Swiss Stage, Round 4 (2-1 bracket)
- **Format:** BO3
- **Stakes:** Winner advances to 3-1 and **qualifies for the Legends stage (playoffs)**. Loser drops to 2-2 with one more chance.
- **FURIA's Path:** Beat B8 2-0 (R1), beat FUT 2-1 (R2, triple OT!), lost to Falcons 1-2 (R3). Strong R2 showing but R3 collapse on Inferno/Anubis.
- **PRV's Path:** Lost to MOUZ 1-2 (R1), beat G2 2-1 (R2, dominated), beat FaZe 2-1 (R3, comeback). Impressive wins over two top-10 teams.
- **Pressure:** Not elimination, but qualifying for playoffs is massive for both. PRV has the momentum advantage — back-to-back wins over G2 and FaZe.
- **Crowd Factor:** LAN in Romania. Both teams have global fanbases. FURIA has massive Brazilian support (gaules stream at 4,600 viewers even pre-match).

## 10. Red Flags & X-Factors

```
RED FLAGS:
├── FURIA
│   ├── Lost 0-2 to PARIVISION in H2H (BLAST Bounty SF, 3 weeks ago)
│   ├── FalleN at 0.93 rating — IGL fragging is a liability (effectively 4v5 in duels)
│   ├── yuurih at 0.95 — FURIA's lurker is underperforming
│   ├── Inferno collapsed 4-13 vs Falcons at PGL R3 — inconsistent
│   ├── Dust2 is ~40% — can't compete with PRV's 83.3% signature
│   └── Nuke (their strong map) is permabanned by PRV for free
├── PARIVISION
│   ├── zweih is NEW (1 month, 33 maps) — integration risk under pressure
│   ├── Overpass 3-13 loss to MOUZ — can collapse badly on uncomfortable maps
│   ├── Mirage 2-13 loss to FaZe — not invulnerable even on strong maps
│   ├── Anubis data is tiny (2-1, 3 maps)
│   └── IEM Krakow exit was early (13-16th) — inconsistent between events

X-FACTORS:
├── FalleN's Major experience — has been in these spots dozens of times
├── Jame's Dust2 AWP — nearly unbeatable on PARIVISION's best map
├── KSCERATO + molodoy (both 1.15) — FURIA's star duo can carry any map
├── PRV's momentum — beating G2 and FaZe back-to-back builds confidence
├── H2H mental edge — PRV already knows they can beat FURIA
└── Anubis decider would be chaos — both teams volatile, small samples
```

## 11. Series Prediction

**Predicted Maps:**
- Map 1: Mirage (FURIA pick) → **FURIA wins 13-10**
- Map 2: Dust2 (PRV pick) → **PRV wins 13-7**
- Map 3: Anubis (Decider) → **FURIA wins 16-14 OT**

**Series Result:** FURIA wins **2-1**
**Confidence:** Low-Medium

**Most Likely Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Probability | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| FURIA 2-1 | 30% | Split picks, FURIA takes Anubis decider on star power (KSCERATO/molodoy). |
| PRV 2-1 | 28% | Split picks, PRV takes decider. H2H supports PRV's ability to beat FURIA on any map. Very plausible. |
| FURIA 2-0 | 15% | FURIA steals Dust2 — requires PRV's 83% map to crack. Unlikely but FURIA has upset capability. |
| PRV 2-0 | 27% | PRV wins Dust2 + steals Mirage (H2H: already beat FURIA 13-8 on Mirage). This is the scariest scenario for FURIA. |

**FURIA ML probability:** ~57%
**PARIVISION ML probability:** ~43%

**Reasoning:** This match is significantly closer than rankings suggest (#2 vs #6). Key factors:

1. **H2H favors PRV** (2-0, won both maps including FURIA's Mirage) — per Principle #1, this is the strongest signal, even though the sample is thin (2 maps).
2. **PRV's Dust2 at 83.3% is virtually guaranteed** — FURIA can't ban it and can't compete (~40%).
3. **PRV's map pool is broader** — 5 maps at 60%+ vs FURIA's 3 (one of which PRV permabans).
4. **PRV has momentum** — beat G2 and FaZe at this event, won BLAST Bounty. Playing with house money.
5. **FURIA has the individual star edge** — KSCERATO + molodoy at 1.15 are the best players in this matchup.
6. **FalleN's experience** matters in tight deciders — his 20+ years of competitive CS can't be quantified.

The swing factor is whether PRV can steal Mirage (as they did in H2H). If they do, it's 2-0 PRV. If FURIA holds Mirage, the series goes to a volatile Anubis decider.

## 12. Prediction vs Market

| Outcome | My Probability | Polymarket | Edge | Signal |
|---------|---------------|------------|------|--------|
| FURIA ML | 57% | 66.5% | -9.5% | Fade FURIA |
| PRV ML | 43% | 33.5% | **+9.5%** | **Marginal Value** (H2H supported) |
| Map 1: FURIA | ~60% | 60.5% | -0.5% | No Value |
| Over 2.5 maps | ~65% | 54.5% | +10.5% | **Value** |
| Under 2.5 maps | ~35% | 45.5% | -10.5% | Fade |
| PRV +1.5 maps | ~85% | 61.5% | **+23.5%** | **STRONG VALUE** |
| FURIA -1.5 maps | ~15% | 38.5% | -23.5% | Fade |

**Value Plays:**

1. **PRV +1.5 Maps at 61.5% (1.63 odds) — BEST BET.** My model says ~85%. PRV's Dust2 at 83.3% makes it nearly impossible for FURIA to sweep. For FURIA to 2-0, they'd need to beat PRV on their 83% map — the probability of that happening is <20%. The market is massively underpricing PRV's ability to win at least 1 map. 23.5% edge.

2. **Over 2.5 Maps at 54.5% (1.83 odds) — VALUE.** My model says ~65%. Each team has a dominant pick (FURIA Mirage ~67%, PRV Dust2 83.3%). The probability of both picks winning is high, making a 3-map series the most likely outcome. 10.5% edge.

3. **PRV ML at 33.5% (2.99 odds) — MARGINAL VALUE.** My model says ~43%. The 9.5% edge is close to the 10% threshold. Per Principle #27, I'd normally not call this value — but the H2H directly supports PRV (2-0 over FURIA). The combination of H2H support + structural map pool advantage + momentum makes this borderline actionable. PRV at 2.99 odds is worth a small position.

**Market Efficiency Notes:**
- The market overvalues FURIA by ~9.5% — driven by ranking prestige (#2) and Brazilian fanbase liquidity. The market hasn't fully priced in the H2H loss and PRV's structural map advantage.
- HLTV books are even more biased toward FURIA (~70% vs Polymarket's 66.5%). The Polymarket line is closer to reality.
- PRV +1.5 is the clearest mispricing. Dust2 at 83.3% = near-guaranteed map win. The market is pricing a sweep at ~38.5% which is absurdly high against a team with an 83% signature map.
